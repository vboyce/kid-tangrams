# kid-tangrams

## how transcripts were tagged

For the game (non-intro) parts of games that are included (not pilots, not excluded), checked transcripts against videos and filled in as needed (time stamps on fill are approximate and copied from adjacent lines). 

For these, tagging
* role = L or S for child
* trial # -- when a trial starts (roughly, it's in the fill between descriptions)
* echo: is this an RA echoing (note: probably incomplete, echoing was very common in expt 1)
* description: what is the target tangram being called? (note: if the exact same thing is said or restarted, only a clean part of the "noun")
* backchannel: Y for all game-relevant kid speech (which isn't necessarily backchannel)
