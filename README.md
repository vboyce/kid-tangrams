# kid-tangrams


# Repo organization

* Experiments contains the code to host/run the tablet experiments as well as the guidance we have to experimenters on how to run the expts
* Data contains transcripts and performance data for children
* Code contains analytic code for data processing and analyses (and saved model results)
* Write-ups contains presentations and manuscripts
* leung_data contains public data from Leung et al. 2024 paper, which we compared against in some preliminary analyses

## how transcripts were tagged

For the game (non-intro) parts of games that are included (not pilots, not excluded), checked transcripts against videos and filled in as needed (time stamps on fill are approximate and copied from adjacent lines). 

For these, tagging
* role = L or S for child
* trial # -- when a trial starts (roughly, it's in the fill between descriptions)
* echo: is this an RA echoing (note: probably incomplete, echoing was very common in expt 1)
* description: what is the target tangram being called? (note: if the exact same thing is said or restarted, only a clean part of the "noun")
* backchannel: Y for all game-relevant kid speech (which isn't necessarily backchannel)

## tagging Leung data for comparison

* rough pass, currently some inconsistency that could be cleaned up
