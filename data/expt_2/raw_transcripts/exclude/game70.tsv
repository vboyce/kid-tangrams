0	7000	Alright, now I'm on camera and if you ever want to leave the game room, just let me know, okay?	R					
7000	10000	We only know now.	id128					
10000	15000	Alright, now today we're going to be playing a matching game.	R					
15000	20000	But before that, we're going to practice touching our iPod to ping a game with popping bubbles.	R					
20000	25000	So you're going to tap the blue button on your screen and press all the bubbles.	R					
26000	30000	No, the item that you popped is you want to pop all the bubbles.	R					
35000	36000	I win.	id128					
36000	37000	Does it tap?	id128					
37000	39000	You want to tap all those levels again too.	R					
42000	43000	That one's not that.	R					
49000	50000	You see this?	id128					
50000	51000	Nice.	R					
51000	53000	Okay, now you can tap those bubbles too [id127].	R					
53000	57000	Alright, now I'm just going to hold this until we get to the next part.	R					
58000	61000	Oh wait, no, let's stay in our chair, [id128].	R					
61000	63000	Hey, I win you.	id127					
63000	64000	Okay, great.	R					
64000	65000	Great job popping the levels.	R					
65000	66000	I have the won.	id128					
66000	67000	Okay.	R					
67000	68000	I win also.	id127					
68000	71000	Now, okay, now I'm going to explain the matching game.	R					
71000	75000	So in this game, you're going to be helping Smurphy.	R					
75000	76000	This is Smurphy.	R					
76000	77000	Do you want to say hi, Smurphy?	R					
77000	78000	the ipad.	id128					
78000	80000	Oh, I'm going to flip back when it's time.	R					
81000	82000	Yeah.	R					
82000	84000	So in the game, we're going to be helping Smurphy.	R					
84000	85000	This is Smurphy.	R					
85000	86000	Do you want to say hi?	R					
86000	87000	Hi.	id128					
87000	88000	Do you want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
88000	89000	Hi, Smurphy.	id127					
89000	90000	Great.	R					
90000	95000	Now, on your screens, you're each going to see two pictures.	R					
95000	98000	And for one of you, the picture will be inside of a black box.	R					
98000	104000	It is Smurphy's job to guess which picture is inside of the black box, and he needs your help.	R					
104000	108000	Now, if you have a picture inside of a black box, that means you're the teller.	R					
108000	113000	And it's your job to tell Smurphy what you see inside of the black box.	R					
113000	116000	It’s so dark.	id128					
116000	118000	Yeah, it's a matching game.	R					
118000	121000	Now, if you don't have the black box, that means you're the guesser.	R					
121000	125000	So you're holding Smurphy, and it's your job to help Smurphy guess.	R					
125000	132000	When you think you know what the teller is telling you, you're going to tap what you guess it is on your screen.	R					
132000	137000	Now, if you tap correctly and guess correctly, you'll get a smiley face.	R					
137000	140000	But if you guess incorrectly, you'll get a sad face.	R					
140000	144000	But that's okay, because you have many times to help Smurphy.	R					
144000	150000	Now, again, if you get a black box, what role are you?	R					
150000	151000	Teller.	id128					
151000	153000	Exactly, you're the teller.	R					
153000	157000	And if you don't have a black box and you're holding Smurphy, what role are you?	R					
		this game is confusing	id127					
157000	160000	It's okay, we'll learn as we go.	R					
160000	164000	Then what are you if you don't have the black box?	R					
164000	166000	I'm...	id128					
166000	170000	If you don't have the black box, then you're the guesser, and you're helping Smurphy guess.	R					
170000	173000	Alright, now we're ready to play.	R					
173000	176000	So I'm going to take these.	R					
		this is confusing.	id127					
176000	181000	And then, it's okay, we're going to learn as we go.	R					
181000	185000	And now, you can press the blue button on your screen to start.	R					
185000	187000	Alright, now who has the black box?	R	0				
187000	192000	Or, you can press two.	R					
192000	193000	Who?	id128		L			
193000	197000	Alright, so you have the black box, you're the teller, and you're the guesser.	R
