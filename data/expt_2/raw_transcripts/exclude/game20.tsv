		This is easy.	id66					
		It is easy huh? Okay perfect. So now you see a picture of Smurphy right? So we're ready to play the game but let me explain to you how we're gonna play the game.	R					
237660	255660	So mine is a really fun matching game and you're gonna see on your screens two pictures. One of you guys will have a picture with a black box and Smurphy's job is to guess what picture is in the black box. If you have the black box you're gonna be the teller.	R					
255660	282660	But how do we know what's inside the box? 	id66					
		I'll show you. You'll see. 	R					
		What's happened? 	id66					
		No that's okay. You can just leave it like that. So let me explain. So there's gonna be a black box and there's gonna be a picture inside the black box. If you have the black box you're gonna be the teller and you're gonna tell Smurphy what you see. If you don't have the black box then you're gonna be holding Smurphy and you're gonna help Smurphy guess what's in the black box. Okay.	R					
283660	293660	You guys are gonna take turns telling and guessing and if you get it right you'll see a smiley face and if you don't you'll see a frowny face but that's okay because you're gonna have a lot of chances to help Smurphy win. Okay.	R					
294660	303660	So let's recap. 	R					
		But how do we know what's inside? 	id66					
		You'll see a picture and then you're gonna describe it. So if you have a black box then you're gonna tell. 	R					
		What does that mean?	id66					
303660	313660	It means you're gonna tell Smurphy and [id67] what you see in the black box. You'll see. Ready? We can try it but let's recap. So if you see a black box what are you gonna do?	R					
314660	331660	Or if I see a black box. 	id67					
		Then you're gonna tell. 	R					
		Do I press the blue? 	id67					
		Okay. Give me one second. So if you see a black box you're gonna tell. You're gonna use your words and you're gonna tell. If you don't see a black box and you're holding Smurphy.	R					
333660	343660	Then give me one second. It's just connecting to the wifi. Okay let’s stay seated okay. It's working now.	R					
344660	351660	Okay [id67] can you take a seat for me please? That just means we're ready to play.	R					
		What does that mean? 	id67					
		That just means we’re ready to play.	R					
352660	361660	Oh let's pop the bubble super quick. Okay now we're ready to play. So here's Smurphy and you guys remember.	R					
361660	368660	Okay if you see the black box you tell. If you're holding Smurphy then you're gonna help him guess and we're using only our words okay.	R					
369660	373660	But then Smurphy will know if we tell.	id66					
374660	378660	Yeah you're supposed to help Smurphy because Smurphy has to guess. So let's press the blue button and get started.	R					
379660	380660	I'll press the blue button.	id67					
381660	382660	Okay you'll get a blue button soon.	R
