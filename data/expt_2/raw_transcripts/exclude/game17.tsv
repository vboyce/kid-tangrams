71000	73000	That's the next game that we're going to play.	R					
73000	77000	In the matching game, we're going to help our friend, Smurphy.	R					
77000	79000	Do you guys want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
79000	80000	Hi, Smurphy.	id62					
80000	82000	Hello, [id62]. Hi, [id61].	R					
82000	83000	Hello, Smurphy.	id61					
83000	88000	Okay, in your game, both of you are going to see two pictures on your screen.	R					
88000	89000	Okay?	id61					
89000	93000	But one of you is going to have a black box around one of your pictures.	R					
93000	96000	Smurphy is going to try and guess.	R					
96000	98000	Yeah, you'll see it in a second. I'll tell you.	R					
98000	103000	But Smurphy is going to try and guess which picture has the black box around it.	R					
103000	104000	Okay?	R					
104000	107000	So one of you, you're going to both see two pictures on your screen,	R					
107000	109000	but one of you is going to have a black box.	R					
109000	112000	If you have the black box, then you are the teller.	R					
112000	117000	And the teller is going to tell Smurphy which picture has the black box in it.	R					
117000	120000	If you're holding Smurphy, you're going to be the guesser.	R					
120000	124000	And you're going to help Smurphy guess which picture has the black box around it.	R					
124000	128000	Once you think you know which picture has the black box around it,	R					
128000	130000	you're going to guess and click it for Smurphy.	R					
130000	133000	If you get it right, you're going to see a Smily face.	R					
133000	135000	If you get it wrong, you'll see a Frowny face.	R					
135000	139000	But that's okay, because we'll have lots of chances to help Smurphy get the right answer.	R					
139000	140000	Okay?	R					
140000	141000	So let's review.	R
