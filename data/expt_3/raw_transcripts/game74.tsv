0	6600	I'm just turning the camera on so we can remember how you play the game, okay?	R					
6600	10200	And then I'll just help. Oh, you got it on your own.	R					
10200	13920	And let me know if you want to go back to the room at any point, okay?	R					
13920	19440	All right, so today we're going to play a fun matching game.	R					
19440	24280	But before we do that, we're going to play a little game of popping bubbles, okay?	R					
24280	27760	So can you guys press the blue buttons on there for me?	R					
28520	31840	And then can you just pop all the bubbles on your screen?	R					
32680	34680	Yeah, just tap it.	R					
36280	38280	There you go, looks good.	R					
41280	43280	Can you pop the other ones too?	R					
44520	48000	Oh, great, really already finished. Now we'll just wait for [id234].	R					
49720	51160	Awesome.	R					
51160	55280	So today we're going to help out Smurphy. This is Smurphy. You guys want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
56240	58240	Smurphy says hi.	R					
58520	61480	So each of you will see two pictures on your screen.	R					
62080	65680	One of the pictures will be surrounded by a black box and	R					
66320	70600	Smurphy's job is to guess which picture is inside the black box.	R					
71240	75760	So if you do see the black box on your screen, then your job is the teller.	R					
75960	79920	You have to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
80360	86960	If you're holding Smurphy, then your job is the guesser and your job is to help Smurphy guess	R					
87200	89280	which picture is in the black box.	R					
89800	95400	If you think you know which picture is in the black box, you're just going to touch that picture.	R					
96440	101600	If you get it right, you'll get a smiley face. If you don't, you'll get a frowny face.	R					
102200	105520	But that's okay because Smurphy has a lot more chances to guess.	R					
105760	109360	You'll take terms guessing and telling.	R					
110720	115160	So if you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
		Tap it	id233					
117840	121840	You're going to tell Smurphy. You're going to tell Smurphy what's in the black box.	R					
122160	127080	If you're holding Smurphy and you don't see the black box, what do you do?	R					
		tap it	id234					
128720	134640	Yeah, then you tap. Then you're going to help Smurphy guess by tapping which picture is in the black box.	R					
136240	138240	It'll make more sense once we start.	R					
138640	143000	Alright, so each of you, can you tap the blue box on your screens?	R					
145000	147240	Alright, which of you sees the black box?	R	1				
148360	152760	Alright, so you're going to be telling and you're going to be guessing. You can hold Smurphy.	R					
154360	156360	What do you see [id234]?	R					
		um, banana	id234		S		banana

178000	180000	Do you want to say it again, [id233]?	R
