19000	22000	Okay, so before we play our fun matching game,	R					
22000	25000	we're going to practice touching our iPads	R					
25000	28000	by playing a little game of pumping bubbles.	R					
28000	32000	Okay, so you all want to press the blue buttons on your screen.	R					
32000	33000	Okay.	id246					
33000	36000	And then pop all the bubbles.	R					
36000	39000	Yeah.	id246					
39000	40000	I did them all.	id245					
40000	44000	And then get the new ones, yeah.	R					
44000	47000	We just check.	R					
47000	50000	Awesome, thank you guys so much.	R					
50000	53000	So now I'm going to explain the matching game.	R					
53000	57000	So each of you on your screen is going to see two pictures.	R					
57000	62000	And one of you will see a picture surrounded by a black box.	R					
62000	64000	And that person is the teller.	R					
64000	70000	And the teller's job is to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
70000	71000	This is Smurphy.	R					
71000	73000	Do you guys want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
73000	74000	Hi Smurphy.	id246					
74000	75000	Hi Smurphy.	id245					
75000	77000	So we're going to be helping Smurphy out today.	R					
77000	78000	Okay.	id246					
78000	82000	If you don't see the black box and you're holding Smurphy,	R					
82000	84000	then you're the guesser.	R					
84000	89000	And your job is to guess which picture is in the black box.	R					
89000	92000	When you think you know which picture it is,	R					
92000	95000	you're going to touch that picture, okay?	R					
96000	99000	If you get it right, you'll see a smiley face.	R					
99000	102000	If you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
102000	105000	But that's okay because Smurphy has a lot of chances.	R					
105000	106000	How many chances?	id246					
106000	108000	A good one, like 10 or 15.	R					
108000	113000	So you're going to take terms guessing and telling, okay?	R					
113000	114000	Okay.	id246					
114000	117000	If you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
117000	118000	Guess.	id246					
118000	124000	You're going to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
124000	128000	If you're holding Smurphy, what do you do?	R					
128000	129000	Guess.	id246					
129000	130000	Yeah.	R					
130000	131000	How do you guess?	R					
131000	134000	You're going to touch the picture.	R					
134000	135000	Yeah.	id246					
135000	136000	Okay?	R
