19000	22000	So today we're going to play a fun matching game,	R					
22000	24500	but first to practice touching the iPads,	R					
24500	26000	we're gonna pop some bubbles.	R					
26000	28500	So go ahead and press the blue button to start.	R					
31000	35000	All right, and then just keep tapping on the bubbles until there's none left.	R					
38000	40000	I did all of them.	id278					
40000	42000	Oh, it looks like there's still some left.	R					
48000	49000	Good job, friends!	R					
49000	53000	All right, let me take these back while I explain our game.	R					
53000	56000	So, who you saw in the picture was Smurphy.	R					
56000	58000	This is Smurphy, do you want to say hi?	R					
58000	59000	Hi, Smurphy.	id277					
59000	60000	Hi, [id277].	R					
60000	61000	Hi, [id278].	R					
61000	66000	All right, so today we're gonna help out Smurphy by playing the matching game.	R					
66000	70000	So on your iPads, you guys are both gonna see two pictures like this.	R					
70000	74000	Now, one of you is gonna see a black box around one of the pictures.	R					
74000	77000	You see how this one has a black box around it?	R					
77000	80000	So if you see this black box, you're gonna be the teller,	R					
80000	85000	and you're gonna help tell Smurphy and our other friend what we see inside the box.	R					
85000	87000	So this one, what do we see inside the box?	R					
87000	88000	Banana!	id277					
88000	91000	Banana, so you'd say banana.	R					
91000	93000	Now, oh, that's not touched the iPads just yet.	R					
93000	98000	Now, if you don't see the black box, you're gonna be holding Smurphy and you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
98000	101000	So the teller's gonna tell you what they see in the black box,	R					
101000	106000	and once you think you know, you're gonna tap on the picture that you think is inside the box.	R					
106000	111000	Now, if you guess incorrectly, you're gonna see a frowny face,	R					
111000	114000	but if you guess correctly, you're gonna see a smiley face.	R					
114000	119000	But it's okay if we get it wrong because we're gonna have a lot of different chances to help out Smurphy.	R					
119000	123000	So we're gonna take turns guessing and telling.	R					
123000	127000	So if you see the black box, what are you gonna do?	R					
127000	128000	Tap it.	id278					
128000	130000	No, we're not gonna tap it.	R					
130000	133000	We're gonna tell our other friend what we see inside the black box.	R					
133000	135000	So we'll say banana.	R					
135000	142000	But if we don't see the black box, then we're gonna tap the picture and guess which one it is.	R					
142000	143000	All right.	R					
143000	144000	Now, can you give us the ipads?	id277					
144000	145000	Yes.	R					
145000	146000	Are you guys ready to play?	R					
146000	147000	All right.	R					
147000	148000	You can type.	R					
148000	150000	Press the blue button to start.	R					
151000	152000	All right.	R					
152000	153000	Who sees the black box?	R	1				
153000	154000	I do.	id277		S			
154000	155000	You do?	R					
155000	156000	I don't.	id278		L			
156000	158000	That means that [id278] gets to hold Smurphy.	R					
158000	163000	So, [id277], can you describe what you see inside the black box?	R					
163000	164000	Apple.	id277		S		apple	Y
164000	165000	All right.	R					
165000	167000	And then you get to guess, [id278].	R					
167000	171000	You get to tap on which picture you think [id277]'s talking about.	R					
172000	174000	You might have to tap a little harder.	R					
177000	178000	All right.	R					
178000	180000	Just maybe tap a little bit harder.	R					
183000	184000	I can't.	id278		L			
184000	185000	You can't?	R					
185000	186000	All right.	R					
186000	187000	Just try doing it.	R					
187000	188000	Maybe a little more gently.	R					
189000	190000	There you go.	R					
190000	192000	I see both of them.	id277	2	L			
192000	193000	Oh, it's okay.	R					
193000	194000	Oh, let's sit down.	R					
194000	198000	I see something in the box.	id278		S			Y
198000	199000	I don't see any.	id277		L			Y
199000	200000	All right.	R

206000	207000	Good job.	R	3				
207000	208000	All right.	R					
208000	210000	Now it's [id278]'s turn to guess again.	R					
210000	212000	I see one.	id277		S			Y
212000	214000	What do you see inside the box?	R					
214000	215000	I don't know.	id277		S			Y
215000	218000	Oh, let's not show the other friend.	R					
218000	220000	Let's just use our words to describe.	R					
220000	221000	Okay?	R	4				
221000	224000	So from now on, let's not turn the iPads around.	R					
224000	226000	Let's just use our words to describe.	R					
226000	228000	I see something inside the box.	id278		S			Y

235000	237000	Go ahead and tap it if you think.	R					
237000	240000	Probably maybe a little bit more gentle.	R					
242000	243000	There you go.	R	5				
243000	244000	All right.	R					
244000	247000	Now it's [id278]'s turn to guess.	R

277000	279000	That's okay.	R					
279000	281000	I see nothing.	id277		L			Y

415000	421000	So instead of saying which side it's on, you should use your words to say the kinds of shapes you see	R					
421000	426000	or what you think the picture is.	R					
426000	432000	So can you use words, [id277], to tell [id278] and Smurfy what you see?	R
