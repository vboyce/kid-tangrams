7000	12000	So, today we're going to play a fun matching game.	R					
12000	16000	But first, I'm going to have you practice touching the iPads by popping some bubbles.	R					
16000	19000	So, go ahead and press the blue button to start.	R					
19000	23000	And then just keep tapping on the bubbles until they go away.	R					
24000	27000	Done.	id279					
27000	30000	Oh, I think there's some more that might have popped up.	R					
32000	34000	Oh, [id280] is done.	R					
34000	36000	All right, let’s wait for [id279] to be done.	R					
36000	39000	All right, and [id279]'s done. All right.	R					
43000	46000	All right. So, today, like I said, we're going to play a matching game.	R					
46000	48000	And in our game, we're going to help our friends, Murphy.	R					
48000	50000	This is Murphy. You want to say hi?	R					
50000	52000	Hi. Hi.	id279					
52000	54000	Hi, [id279].	R					
54000	57000	All right. So, we're going to help Murphy.	R					
57000	61000	So, on your iPads, you guys are going to see two pictures like this.	R					
61000	66000	Now, one of you guys is going to see a black box around one of the pictures.	R					
66000	68000	You see how there's a black box around this picture?	R					
68000	70000	And then you press...	id279					
70000	72000	Something like that. Let me explain.	R					
72000	75000	So, if you see the black box, you are the teller.	R					
75000	80000	And you're going to help tell Murphy and the other friend what you see inside the black box.	R					
80000	82000	So, what would you say if you were the teller?	R					
82000	84000	Banana.	id279					
84000	86000	Yeah, you'll say, I see a banana.	R					
86000	89000	Now, if you don't see the black box, you're going to be holding Murphy.	R					
89000	92000	And you're going to guess what's inside the black box.	R					
92000	95000	So, when the teller tells you what's inside the box,	R					
95000	99000	you're going to press on the picture that you think is inside the box.	R					
99000	101000	Does that make sense?	R					
101000	103000	Yeah. 	id280					
		Okay.	id279					
103000	106000	All right. So, if you guess correctly, then you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
106000	109000	But if you guess incorrectly, you're going to see a frowny face.	R					
109000	113000	But that's okay because we're going to have a lot of different chances to help Murphy.	R					
113000	115000	Okay.	id279					
115000	117000	Yeah, exactly.	R					
117000	119000	Okay.	id280					
119000	122000	So, we're going to take turns being the guesser and the teller.	R					
122000	125000	So, if you see the black box, what are you going to do?	R					
125000	127000	Press that one.	id280					
127000	133000	Oh, not press it. You're going to tell with words to Murphy and the other friend what you see.	R					
133000	135000	But if you don't see the black box, then...	R					
135000	140000	You’re going to say Smurfy like shout	id279					
140000	143000	You don't have to shout. You could just say his name.	R					
143000	146000	But does that make sense, guys? Are you ready to play?	R					
146000	148000	Okay.	R					
148000	150000	So, press the blue button to start.	R					
150000	152000	Now, which one of you has the black box?	R	1				
152000	154000	Banana.	id279		S		banana	Y
154000	157000	Oh, [id279] has a black box. So, [id280] will hold Murphy.	R					
157000	159000	All right.	R					
159000	161000	So, [id279] just said what he sees inside the black box.	R					
161000	164000	So, [id280], you can press on which picture you think it is.	R					
164000	170000	Just tap on it a little more gently.	R					
170000	172000	There you go.	R	2				
172000	174000	And now, [id280] has a black box.	R					
174000	179000	So, Murphy's going to go with [id279].	R					
179000	182000	So, let's just use our words.	R					
182000	184000	Let's not turn the iPads around.	R					
184000	186000	Can you just describe what you see inside the box?	R					
186000	188000	to [id279] and Murphy?	R					
188000	194000	I see a bird inside the box.	id280		S		a bird	Y
194000	196000	That's okay.	R	3				
196000	198000	All right. Now, it's [id280]'s turn.	R					
198000	200000	What do you see inside the box, [id279]?	R					
200000	202000	What?	id280		L			
202000	206000	Like a star, like this. 	id279		S		a star	Y
206000	209000	Yeah, just use your words.	R					
209000	212000	Just use your best guess.	R					
212000	214000	And use your words to communicate with each other.	R					
214000	217000	You can ask questions to [id279] if you're stuck.	R					
217000	219000	This one.	id280		L			Y
219000	221000	This one.	id280		L			Y
221000	223000	Yay!	R					
223000	225000	Good job.	R	4				
225000	227000	Yay!	id279		L			
227000	231000	All right. Now, you can explain what you see in the black box to [id279] and Murphy.	R					
231000	233000	I see...	id280		S			Y
233000	235000	Maybe it's a crown?	id280		S		a crown	Y
235000	238000	Maybe. Let's keep the iPads turned towards ourselves.	R					
238000	240000	Okay.	id280		S			
240000	242000	Uh...	id280		S			
242000	244000	Uh...	id280		S

247000	249000	Yay!	id279		S			
249000	251000	Now, let's pass Murphy to [id280].	R					
251000	254000	Hey, look at this walking guy.	id279		S		walking guy	Y
254000	256000	How about this one?	id280		L

258000	260000	Oh, that's okay.	R					
260000	264000	A person walking with a bag.	id279		L			
264000	267000	All right. Now, let's try not to guess.	R					
267000	273000	Friends, let's try not to guess before the person finishes telling us what we see.	R					
273000	278000	So, [id280], can you explain what you see in the box?	R					
278000	280000	A person sitting.	id280		S		a person sitting	Y

287000	289000	Oh, yay!	id280		L			
292000	295000	Oh, let's not guess before we...	R	8				
295000	297000	before our friend has a chance to tell.	R					
297000	299000	A person walking?	id279		L			Y
299000	301000	No.	id279		L			
301000	303000	It’s [id280]’s turn to tell. 	R					
303000	305000	So, what do you see inside the box?	R					
305000	307000	It's...	id280		S			Y

327000	329000	All right.	R

355000	357000	That's okay.	R	11				
358000	361000	A person walking with a bag.	id279		S		a person walking with a bag	Y
363000	365000	Oh, that's okay.	R	12				
365000	367000	But remember, let's let [id279]...	R					
367000	369000	let's let [id279] describe what he sees.	R					
369000	371000	I guess it's a person sitting.	id280		S		a person sitting	Y

383000	385000	Let's not...	R	14

473000	475000	[id280], remember, we're not going to guess	R	18

503000	505000	A person...	id279		S			Y
505000	507000	standing.	id279		S			Y
507000	509000	All right, and now you can make your best guess, [id280],	R					
509000	511000	by tapping on which one you think it is.	R					
515000	517000	Good job.	R	20
