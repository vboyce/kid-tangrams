16200	17200	All right, friends.	R					
17200	18200	Let's start.	R					
18200	20200	Yes, we have a stuffy outfit.	R					
20200	21900	Wait, what's his name again?	id267					
21900	25700	His name is Smurphy, but I'll tell you all about him in just a second.	R					
25700	29000	So if you remember, we're going to play a matching game, but first we're going to pop	R					
29200	30200	Bubbles.	R					
30200	32200	So go ahead and press the blue button to start.	R					
40700	42700	I pop it on my bubbles.	id268					
42700	44700	Oh, it looks like there's still some bubbles up.	R					
44700	46700	Just keep popping them until there's none left.	R					
49700	51700	Oh, it looks like you're done.	R					
51700	53700	And [id267]'s almost done too.	R					
55200	56200	Awesome.	R					
56200	58200	Oh, Blippi!	id267					
58900	59900	Smurphy.	R					
59900	61900	All right, friends.	R					
61900	65400	Yeah, Blippi is kind of close to his name.	R					
65400	68900	But yeah, this, I think you already seen him, but his name's Smurphy.	R					
68900	71400	And today we're going to play a matching game to help Smurphy.	R					
71400	72400	Does that sound good?	R					
72400	73400	Yeah.	id268					
73400	74400	All right.	R					
74400	77900	So on your screens, you guys are both going to see two pictures like this.	R					
77900	79900	So two pictures.	R					
79900	84400	Now one of you is going to see one of the pictures in a black box like this.	R					
84400	85400	Banana.	id267					
85400	87400	Yeah, the banana's in the black box.	R					
87400	92400	So our job is to help Smurphy guess which picture is inside the black box.	R					
92400	97400	So if you see the black box on your screen, then that means you're the teller.	R					
97400	100400	And you're going to help tell Smurphy what's inside the black box.	R					
100400	103400	Now one of you is not going to see the black box.	R					
103400	105400	And this means you're going to be the guesser.	R					
105400	109400	And so you're going to be holding Smurphy and you're going to guess what's inside the box.	R					
109400	112400	I already know what it is.	id267					
112400	114400	You already know what it is?	R					
114400	115400	Yeah.	id267					
115400	116400	A banana.	id268					
116400	117400	Yes.	R					
117400	119400	In this case, it's a banana.	R					
119400	124400	But if you guess wrong, then you're going to see a frowny face.	R					
124400	126400	But if you guess right, you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
126400	131400	But it's okay because we're going to take turns and we have lots of chances to help Smurphy out.	R					
131400	132400	Yes.	R					
132400	134400	So who is it?	R					
134400	135400	I don't know.	id268					
135400	138400	But let's focus on the game.	R					
138400	141400	But okay, so we're going to take turns helping Smurphy.	R					
141400	144400	So if you see the black box, what are you going to do?	R					
144400	145400	Press it.	id267					
145400	147400	No, you're not going to press it.	R					
		I don’t know.	id267					
147400	154400	You're going to help tell Smurphy what you see inside the black box.	R					
154400	158400	And then if you don't see anything, then 	R					
		You have to guess.	id267					
158400	161400	You have to guess and you're going to press it once you think you know.	R					
161400	162400	Does that make sense?	R					
162400	163400	All right, friends.	R					
163400	166400	Go ahead and press the blue button to start.	R					
169400	171400	I'm not lacking.	id268					
171400	173400	Oh, there you go.	R					
173400	175400	Okay, so who has the black box?	R					
175400	176400	Oh, you have the black box.	R					
176400	178400	So you're the teller and [id268], you're the guesser.	R					
178400	180400	So you're going to help Smurphy.	R	1				
180400	186400	So, [id267], you are going to tell [id268] and Smurphy what you see in the black box.	R					
186400	187400	Oh.	R					
187400	191400	It looks like you guessed too early.	R					
191400	194400	So now it's going to be [id267]'s turn.	R	2				
194400	196400	So what do you see inside the black box, [id268]?	R					
196400	198400	A bell.	id268		S		a bell	Y
199400	203400	Tell [id268] and Smurphy and then they can guess.	R

205400	207400	A bell.	id268		S			Y

214400	216400	Oh.	id267		S			
218400	220400	All right, [id267], what do you see?	R
