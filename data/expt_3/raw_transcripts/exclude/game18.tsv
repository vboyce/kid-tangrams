16000	22000	But before we do that, we're going to practice touching our iPads by playing a really fun bubble popping game.	R					
22000	28000	Guys ready? Okay, so when you get your iPads, you're going to touch the blue square in the middle of your screen	R					
28000	33000	and then you're going to touch all the bubbles that you see on your screen to make them pop. Okay?	R

74000	80000	Okay, so in the game, both of you are going to see pictures on your iPad screens, okay?	R

89000	92000	Yeah, there's going to be like bananas, apples, all kinds of shapes.	R					
92000	95000	But each time, one of you is going to have a black box around one of your pictures.	R					
95000	101000	If you have a black box, that means you're the teller, and you're going to tell your friend that's holding Smurfy	R					
101000	104000	which one of your pictures has the black box around it.	R					
104000	105000	Okay.	id166					
105000	108000	If you're the friend with holding Smurfy, that means you're the guesser.	R					
108000	114000	And that means that you're going to help Smurfy guess which one of the pictures has the black box around it, okay?	R					
114000	117000	If you guess right, you're going to see a happy face.	R					
117000	119000	If you guess wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
119000	125000	But that's okay, because we'll have lots of chances to help Smurfy guess which picture has the black box around it, okay?	R					
125000	126000	So just to recap.	R					
		Is that gonna be my ipad?	id166					
126000	127000	Yeah, that's going to be your iPad.	R

131000	136000	You're going to tell your friend which picture has the black box.	R					
136000	140000	And if you're holding Smurfy, that means you're the guesser, and you're going to help Smurfy guess, okay?	R
