0	8160	for later. Okay. Alright, so today we're gonna be playing a fun little matching game, but	R					
8160	12200	before we do that we're gonna practice using the iPads. So if you want then you can press	R					
12200	17360	the blue button to get started. And then now you just gotta tap all the blue buttons to	R					
17360	26960	make them pop. Or all the bubbles to make them pop. Yeah, so just keep tapping the bubbles.	R					
26960	30640	So maybe press a little softer. Try pressing a little softer.	R					
30640	35840	I got no more blue one. 	id209					
		Hey, [id210]. Maybe try tapping a little softer.	R					
35840	42200	On each one? Yep, just like that. Nice and gentle. Yep. Oh, so keep popping from the	R					
42200	48320	rest of the bubbles. Oh, let's keep it facing you. And then, yeah, so now let's wait for	R					
48320	58240	[id209] to finish. And then keep popping all the bubbles. Yep. Pop all these. Just go boop,	R					
58240	77320	boop, boop, boop, boop. Maybe a little harder. Awesome. Oh, so don't click that one yet.	R					
77320	82480	We're gonna wait for a second. But yep, it's him. Okay, so this is Murphy. You wanna say	R					
82480	89600	hi, Murphy?	R					
		hi	id209					
			id210					
		 So in this game we're gonna be helping Murphy to guess between two shapes	R					
89600	95600	that you see on the screen. So if you see a black box on your screen, that means you're	R					
95600	100800	gonna be the teller. So if you're the teller, then you're gonna be telling Murphy what you	R					
100800	107240	see inside the black box. So, and then if you're the one holding Murphy, you're gonna	R					
107240	112160	be the guesser. So the guesser is gonna see this. And if you're the guesser, you're gonna	R					
112160	117320	be helping Murphy to guess. And when you think you know, oh yep, so keep it facing you for	R					
117320	124440	now. And I'll tell you when to start. So I'm gonna keep explaining the rules. And if, when	R					
124440	126960	you think you know the right answer, then you're gonna click the answer you think it	R					
126960	130960	is. And if you get it right, you'll see a smiley face. And if you get it wrong, you'll	R					
130960	135400	see a frowny face. But that's okay, because we'll have a lot of chances to help Murphy.	R					
135400	146520	So just to remember, if you see the black box, what are you gonna do?	R					
		Gonna tell.	id209					
		 Yes, the teller.	R					
146520	152400	So you're gonna tell Murphy what you see inside the box. And if you are the one holding Murphy,	R					
152400	157520	what are you gonna do? 	R					
		guess	id210					
		Yes. Yeah, you're gonna be the guesser. Does that make sense, [id209]?	R					
		Yeah.	id209					
157520	162520	Okay, awesome. Let me get started. So now both of you can tap the blue button.	R					
163520	170520	All right, so which one of you has the black box? Okay, so that means you're gonna be the teller,	R	1				
170520	175480	and you're gonna be the guesser. So [id210], do you want to tell [id209] what you see inside the black	R					
175480	182680	box? 	R

		All right, and then to [id209], when you have a guess, then you can click the	R					
182680	185520	screen of the one you think it is, because you're the guesser, since you're holding Murphy.	R					
186520	193520	Perfect. Just like that. And now we're gonna switch over. And now you're turned to be the teller,	R	2				
193520	198520	and you're turned to be the guesser. So [id209].	R					
198520	213520	Um, um, uh, the eagle? 	id209		S		the eagle
