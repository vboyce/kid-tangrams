3920	7960	Alright friends, so today we're going to play a fun matching game, but first I'm going to	R					
7960	13960	have you practice touching the iPads by popping some bubbles, okay?	R					
13960	25960	Alright, go ahead and press the button.	R					
26960	32960	Alright, keep popping the bubbles until you're all done.	R					
32960	35960	Alright, it looks like [id281]'s done.	R					
35960	40960	Keep popping the bubbles, [id282].	R					
40960	42960	I'm a fast popper.	id281					
42960	43960	You're a fast popper.	R					
43960	48960	Alright, so today we're going to play a matching game to help our friends Smurfy.	R					
48960	49960	This is Smurfy.	R					
49960	50960	Do you want to say hi?	R					
50960	52960	Hi guys, how are you?	R					
52960	55960	No right now.	R					
55960	58960	So on your iPads you guys are going to see two pictures.	R					
		Smurfy’s on the ground.	id281					
58960	60960	He's on the ground.	R					
60960	63960	You're going to see two pictures like this.	R					
63960	68960	So one of you is going to see one of the pictures inside of a black box.	R					
68960	70960	You see how this picture's inside the black box?	R					
		banana	id282					
70960	72960	Yeah, the banana's in the black box.	R					
72960	76960	So if you see the black box, you're going to be the teller, and you're going to tell Smurfy	R					
76960	80960	and the other friend what you see inside the box.	R					
80960	86960	Now if you don't see the black box, you're going to be the guesser,	R					
86960	91960	and you're going to help Smurfy guess which picture's inside the black box.	R					
91960	96960	So when you have your guess, you can tap on the iPad which picture you think is inside the box.	R					
96960	100960	Now if you guess correctly, you're going to see a happy face,	R					
100960	103960	but if you don't guess correctly, you're going to see a frowny face.	R					
103960	107960	But that's okay because we're going to have a lot of different chances to help out Smurfy.	R					
108960	110960	Now we're going to take turns guessing and telling.	R					
110960	113960	So if you see a black box, what are you going to do?	R					
116960	120960	You're not going to tap, you're just going to tell the other friend what you see in the box.	R					
120960	123960	So for this, you'll say like, I see a banana.	R					
123960	128960	But if you don't see the black box, then you're going to tap, and you're going to help guess.	R					
128960	129960	Like this.	id281					
129960	130960	Like this, just like that.	R					
130960	132960	Alright, does that make sense?	R
