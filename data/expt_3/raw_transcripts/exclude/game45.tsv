25000	27000	Okay, so today we're going to play a fun matching game.	R					
27000	29000	But before we do that,	R					
29000	31000	we're going to learn how to use the iPads,	R					
31000	33000	which I think you guys already know how to play,	R					
33000	34000	or how to use the iPads.	R					
34000	37000	But you know	R					
		 I have an iPad at home.	id197					
37000	38000	Yeah.	R					
38000	39000	Oh, let's keep it facing you.	R					
39000	42000	How did this go back?	id198					
42000	43000	Go back.	R					
43000	44000	Yeah.	id198					
44000	45000	Oh, well, it's okay.	R					
45000	46000	We can go from here now.	R					
46000	47000	So for this part,	R					
47000	51000	you want to tap the blue button to get started.	R					
51000	52000	Yep.	R					
52000	54000	And then now can you guys tap all the bubbles so we can pop?	R					
54000	56000	This is just a practice using the iPad.	R					
56000	60000	So we're not playing the game yet.	R					
60000	62000	Maybe just use one finger to tap.	R					
62000	63000	Right there.	id198					
63000	64000	Are there more bubbles?	R					
64000	65000	Okay.	R					
65000	67000	So keep pumping the bubbles until there's no more.	R					
67000	68000	Yeah.	R					
68000	69000	Just like that.	R					
69000	70000	Yeah.	R					
70000	71000	Awesome.	R					
71000	72000	Good job, [id198].	R					
72000	73000	Good job, [id197].	R					
73000	74000	Okay.	R					
74000	76000	So now I'm going to explain the rules of the game.	R					
76000	78000	So we're not going to touch the iPads for a second.	R					
78000	79000	So in this game,	R					
79000	80000	we're going to be helping Smurfy.	R					
80000	81000	This is Smurfy.	R					
81000	82000	Do you want to say hi?	R					
82000	83000	Hi.	id198					
83000	84000	Hi.	id198					
84000	85000	Okay.	R					
85000	88000	So Smurfy's job in this game is to try to guess between two shapes	R					
88000	90000	that you're going to see on the iPads.	R					
90000	92000	So on your screens,	R					
92000	94000	one of you is going to see a black box.	R					
94000	96000	And if you see the black box,	R					
96000	98000	your job is to help Smurfy guess.	R					
98000	101000	So you're going to use your words to try to tell Smurfy	R					
101000	103000	what's inside the black box.	R					
103000	105000	You're going to be the teller.	R					
105000	107000	And if you're the one holding Smurfy,	R					
107000	108000	you're going to be the guesser.	R					
108000	110000	So you're going to see the two pictures	R					
110000	112000	and listen to what the teller tells you	R					
112000	114000	and try to guess which picture it is.	R					
114000	116000	And when you think you know which one it is,	R					
116000	119000	you're going to tap the one you think it is.	R					
119000	120000	And if you get it right,	R					
120000	121000	you'll see a smiley face.	R					
121000	122000	And if you get it wrong,	R					
122000	123000	you'll see a frowny face.	R					
123000	124000	But that's okay,	R					
124000	126000	because we'll have a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
126000	129000	So just to remember,	R					
129000	131000	if you see the black box,	R					
131000	133000	what are you going to do?	R					
136000	138000	You're going to be the teller.	R					
138000	139000	So you're going to tell Smurfy	R					
139000	141000	what you see inside the black box.	R					
141000	143000	And if you're the one holding Smurfy,	R					
143000	145000	oh, wait, don't look at his iPad.	R					
145000	147000	We're going to stay sitting in this game.	R					
147000	148000	And if you see,	R					
148000	149000	if you're the one holding Smurfy,	R					
149000	150000	what are you going to do?	R					
153000	154000	You're going to be the guesser.	R					
154000	156000	So you're going to try to help Smurfy guess	R					
156000	157000	which one it is.	R					
157000	158000	And when you think you know the answer,	R					
158000	160000	you're going to tap the one you think it is.	R					
160000	161000	Okay?	R					
161000	164000	I have a lot of stuffed animals at home.	id198					
164000	165000	Nice.	R					
165000	168000	Okay, so just to remember again,	R					
168000	169000	if you see the black box,	R					
169000	170000	what do you do?	R					
179000	181000	If you see the black box,	R					
183000	184000	you're going to be the guesser.	id198					
184000	185000	No, you're going to be the teller.	R					
185000	187000	So if you see the black box,	R					
187000	189000	then you're going to try to tell Smurfy	R					
189000	190000	and the other person	R					
190000	192000	what you see inside the black box.	R					
192000	193000	Is that good?	R					
194000	196000	Okay, so if you see the black box,	R					
196000	197000	what are you going to do?	R					
197000	198000	At my house,	id198					
198000	200000	I play the same game	id198					
200000	202000	as your game room here.	id198					
202000	203000	Yeah.	R					
203000	205000	So what do we do when we see the black box?	R					
210000	211000	The teller.	id198					
211000	212000	Yeah, you're going to be the teller.	R					
212000	213000	So you're going to tell Smurfy	R					
213000	215000	what you see inside the black box.	R					
215000	217000	And if you're the one holding Smurfy,	R					
217000	218000	what are you going to do?	R					
218000	219000	Who are you going to be?	R					
222000	223000	The guesser.	id198					
223000	224000	Yeah, so you're going to guess	R					
224000	225000	which one you think it is.	R					
225000	227000	Okay, I think you guys are ready to play.	R					
228000	230000	So, both of you can click the blue button	R					
230000	231000	to get started.	R					
236000	237000	Alrighty, so which one of you...	R					
237000	238000	Oh, so let's wait until...	R					
238000	240000	So which one of you has the black box?	R	1				
241000	242000	Okay, awesome.	R					
242000	244000	So that means you're going to be the teller	R					
244000	245000	and you're going to be the guesser.	R					
245000	246000	So do you want to take Smurfy?	R					
247000	248000	So now, [id197],	R					
248000	250000	could you tell [id198]	R					
250000	252000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
		I see an apple.	id197		S		an apple	Y
254000	255000	Okay, and then [id198],	R					
255000	256000	when you have a guess,	R					
256000	258000	do you want to click the answer on the screen?	R					
264000	265000	Just click the answer on the screen	R					
265000	267000	and show everyone what you think it is.	R					
267000	268000	Which one is it?	id198		L			Y
269000	270000	[id197]?	R					
		an apple.	id197		S			Y
271000	272000	Okay.	R					
273000	274000	So it was the other one,	R	2				
274000	275000	but that's okay,	R					
275000	276000	we'll have more chances.	R					
276000	277000	So now we're going to switch back	R					
277000	278000	and now you're going to be the guesser	R					
278000	280000	and you're going to be the teller.	R					
280000	281000	So [id198], could you tell [id197]	R					
281000	283000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
283000	284000	A bird.	id198		S		a bird	Y
286000	287000	Nice.	R	3				
287000	288000	Okay.	R					
288000	289000	Now we're going to switch back	R					
289000	290000	and you're going to be the teller	R					
290000	292000	and you're going to be the guesser.	R					
		what?	id197		S			
303000	305000	So [id197], right now you're the teller.	R					
305000	307000	So could you tell [id198] and Smurfy	R					
307000	309000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
336000	338000	I don't know what it is.	id197		S			Y
338000	340000	That's okay if you don't know what it is.	R					
340000	342000	Just, is there anything you could say	R					
342000	343000	or any words you could use	R					
343000	345000	to try to help [id198] guess	R					
345000	346000	which one it is?	R					
348000	349000	This one.	id198		L			Y
349000	351000	Well, we got to wait for [id197]	R					
351000	352000	to tell you what it is.	R					
352000	354000	If you want, you can ask [id197] questions	R					
354000	357000	about what is inside the black box.	R					
357000	359000	Wait, is inside the box?	id198		L			Y
363000	366000	I don’t know	id197		S			Y
366000	368000	Just give it your  best shot.	R					
369000	371000	just like say whatever	R					
371000	373000	whatever words you think it is.	R					
383000	385000	See it right there inside the box.	R					
385000	387000	What do you, what do you see?	R					
388000	390000	Something.	id197		S			Y
390000	391000	Yeah.	R					
393000	395000	So is there anything else you can say about it?	R					
401000	404000	[id198] only can say	id197		S			
404000	408000	about it.	id197		S			
417000	418000	[id198], do you want to try asking	R					
418000	419000	more questions about it?	R					
420000	421000	Sure.	id198		L			
421000	422000	But how?	id198		L			
423000	425000	Just any questions that you have	R					
425000	427000	to try to help you guess between the two.	R					
428000	431000	If you, if you want to just take a guess	R					
431000	433000	you can also do that.	R					
433000	435000	You can just take your best guess.	R					
440000	441000	Use one finger tap.	R					
441000	442000	One finger.	R					
445000	446000	Oh, okay.	R	4				
446000	447000	There's the other one.	R					
447000	448000	But that's okay.	R					
448000	449000	We'll have more chances.	R					
449000	451000	So now we're going to switch back.	R					
451000	452000	And now you're going to be the guesser	R					
452000	454000	and you're going to be the teller.	R					
454000	456000	So [id198], could you tell [id197]	R					
456000	458000	what you see inside the box?	R					
458000	459000	A swirly.	id198		S		a swirly	Y

463000	465000	Do you want to take a guess?	R					
472000	473000	Yeah.	R					
473000	474000	So once you have a guess	R					
474000	475000	then you just click the screen	R					
475000	476000	which one you think it is.	R					
476000	477000	Just a tap.	R					
478000	479000	A flower?	id197		L		a flower	Y
479000	480000	Yeah.	R					
480000	481000	Tap a little harder.	R					
481000	482000	Try it again.	R					
482000	483000	Or like a fast tap.	R					
483000	484000	Like that.	R					
484000	485000	Yeah.	R					
485000	486000	Good job.	R					
486000	487000	That's great.	R					
487000	488000	You're doing great.	R	5				
488000	489000	And so now we're going to switch back.	R					
489000	490000	And now you're going to be the teller	R					
490000	491000	and you're going to be the guesser.	R					
491000	492000	So you're going to have Smurfy.	R					
492000	493000	Okay.	R					
493000	494000	Guesser and teller.	R					
494000	495000	So, [id197], could you tell [id198]	R					
495000	497000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
511000	512000	Uh...	id197		S			
524000	525000	Uh...	id197		S			
525000	526000	You got it.	R					
530000	531000	I see you.	id198		L			Y
531000	532000	Shh.	R					
532000	533000	Now listen to what [id197] has to say about	R					
533000	534000	what's inside the box.	R					
538000	539000	Okay.	R					
541000	545000	[id197], do you want to help Smurfy	R					
545000	547000	and [id198] out by saying what you see	R					
547000	549000	inside the box?	R					
550000	551000	Uh...	id197		S			
551000	554000	I think it's just one of these.	id198		L			Y
554000	555000	Yeah.	R					
555000	556000	Well, it's going to be one of them.	R					
556000	557000	But we need [id197] to tell us	R					
557000	559000	what's inside the box	R					
559000	561000	to help [id198] guess.	R					
561000	562000	Because [id198] doesn't know	R					
562000	563000	which one it is right now.	R					
563000	567000	Well, I still don't know.	id197		S			Y
567000	568000	It's okay if you don't know	R					
568000	569000	what it is.	R					
569000	570000	You can just use your words	R					
570000	572000	to try to, um...	R					
572000	573000	describe it.	R					
596000	597000	So [id197], why don't you just	R					
597000	598000	take your best guess.	R					
598000	599000	Or your best.	R					
599000	600000	Give it your best shot.	R					
604000	606000	So, like, you see it right there.	R					
606000	608000	So...	R					
608000	610000	Do you have anything you can say about it?	R					
619000	620000	I don’t know	id197		S			Y
620000	621000	[id198], do you want to take your best guess	R					
621000	623000	of which one you think it is?	R					
624000	625000	It's this one.	id198		L			Y
625000	626000	Okay.	R					
628000	629000	That's cool.	R					
629000	630000	That was that one.	R	6				
630000	631000	Okay.	R					
631000	632000	Now we're going to switch back	R					
632000	633000	and you're going to be the guesser	R					
633000	634000	and you're going to be the teller.	R					
634000	635000	So [id198], could you tell [id197]	R					
635000	637000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
637000	638000	This.	id198		S			Y
638000	639000	Yeah.	R					
639000	640000	But could you try to describe it?	R					
640000	641000	Or, like, what it...	R					
641000	642000	um...	R					
642000	643000	what it is?	R					
643000	644000	A sculpture?	id198		S		a sculpture	Y
645000	646000	A sculpture?	id198		S			Y
647000	648000	Okay.	R					
648000	650000	[id197], does that help you?	R					
654000	655000	Nice.	R	7				
655000	656000	That was awesome.	R					
656000	657000	So that's how we play the game.	R					
657000	658000	Okay.	R					
658000	659000	So now we're going to switch back	R					
659000	660000	and you're going to be the teller	R					
660000	661000	and you're going to be the guesser.	R					
662000	663000	So now [id197], could you tell [id198]	R					
663000	665000	what you see inside the black box?	R					
		it’s this one	id197		S			Y
669000	670000	Yeah.	R					
670000	671000	But [id198] can't see your screen.	R					
671000	673000	So could you use your words	R					
673000	674000	to try to describe it?	R
