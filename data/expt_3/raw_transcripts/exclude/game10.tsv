4120	6880	Thank you both for playing my game,	R					
6880	9200	[id158] and [id157].	R					
9200	11280	Okay, so today we're gonna play	R					
11280	13200	a really fun matching game.	R					
13200	14560	Are you guys ready?	R					
14560	17940	Okay, but first we're gonna practice touching our iPads	R					
17940	21440	by playing a really fun bubble popping game, okay?	R					
21440	22960	So once you see a bubble, you just...	R					
22960	27080	Wait a second, I've done this before on my dad's iPad.	id158					
27080	28480	You've done it before?	R					
28480	29920	Oh yeah, then you'll be a pro.	R					
29920	32480	You're just gonna touch all of the bubbles that you see.	R					
32480	35480	I do the alphabet with a special pad	id158					
35480	37320	and I play with my daddy too.	id157					
37320	38160	Really?	R					
38160	41280	And I also had a tray flutter	id158					
41280	43400	and then it came up some fun stuff	id158					
43400	45800	and then one of those were popping bubbles.	id158					
45800	47480	Wow, that's amazing.	R					
47480	48800	So you guys are gonna be so good at this.	R					
48800	50160	So you're gonna touch the blue button	R					
50160	51760	in the middle of your iPad to start	R					
51760	53800	and then you're gonna touch all of the bubbles	R					
53800	56560	that you see on your screen and just make them pop.	R					
56560	57680	Yeah, you're gonna touch it to start.	R					
57680	59560	Yeah, good, there you go.	R					
59600	61000	Good job, [id158].	R					
61880	63200	All mine are done.	id158					
63200	64960	Good job, [id157].	R					
65880	67640	You guys are doing so good.	R					
71200	72960	Wait, there's another popping.	id158					
72960	74480	Oh, there we go.	R					
74480	75480	Good job.	R					
75480	78120	Okay, I'm gonna take the iPad from you real quick.	R					
78120	80680	We're gonna wait for [id157] to finish.	R					
80680	81960	Good job, [id157].	R					
83680	84760	Just a few more.	R					
86760	87600	Good job.	R					
89680	90520	Good job.	R					
94440	95280	Good job.	R					
100920	101760	Give me high five.	R					
101760	102800	Both of you guys are so good.	R					
102800	104560	Okay, now I'm going to explain	R					
104560	106560	the matching game to you both, okay?	R					
106560	107880	So in our matching game,	R					
107880	110280	we're gonna help our friend, Smurphy.	R					
110280	112200	This is Smurphy, do you wanna say hi?	R					
112200	113560	Hi, [id157].	R					
113560	114400	Hi.	id157					
114400	115680	Hi, [id158].	R					
115680	117080	Okay, so in this game,	R					
117080	119560	we're gonna help Smurphy guess some pictures.	R					
119560	121840	So on each of your screens,	R					
121840	124960	you guys are gonna see two pictures, okay?	R					
124960	127760	But one of you is going to see a black box	R					
127760	129480	around one of the pictures.	R					
129480	131800	Smurphy's job is to guess	R					
131800	133200	which one of these pictures	R					
133200	135520	has the black box around it, okay?	R					
135520	137960	So if you see the black box around your screen,	R					
137960	140080	that means that you're the teller.	R					
140080	142480	And that means that you're gonna tell Smurphy	R					
142480	145320	which one of these pictures has the black box around it,	R					
145320	146160	which means you're gonna have	R					
146160	148880	to describe what's inside the box, okay?	R					
148880	152400	If you have these on your screen without any black box,	R					
152400	153880	that means you're the guesser.	R					
153880	155640	And you're gonna be holding Smurphy,	R					
155640	157240	and you guys are gonna be guessing	R					
157240	159400	which picture has the black box.	R					
159400	162280	You're gonna press the picture you think has the black box.	R					
162280	163680	If you guys get it right,	R					
163680	165440	you're gonna see a happy face.	R					
165440	166880	If you guys guess it wrong,	R					
166880	168680	you'll see a frowny face, but that's okay,	R					
168680	170480	because you guys are gonna have lots of chances	R					
170480	173040	to help Smurphy guess the right picture, okay?	R					
173040	175240	So we're gonna switch places every time	R					
175280	177160	who's the guesser and who's the teller.	R					
177160	179520	So if you see a black box around your screen,	R					
179520	180560	who are you?	R					
180560	181400	The teller.	id158					
181400	183960	You are the teller, that's correct, [id158].	R					
183960	186200	And if there's no black box around your screen	R					
186200	188560	and holding Smurphy, you are the …	R					
		guesser	id158					
188560	190280	Guesser, good job.	R					
190280	192680	Okay, we're gonna start, you guys ready?	R					
192680	195040	You're just gonna press the blue box to get started.	R					
195040	196440	And then we'll see who has the black box	R					
196440	198080	around their picture first.	R					
199280	202760	Okay, who has the black box?	R	1				
202760	205160	Oh, you have the black box, so you're gonna be the teller.	R					
205160	206240	You're gonna be the teller, [id158],	R					
206240	208000	and you're gonna be the guesser, [id157].	R					
208000	210560	So, [id158], tell [id157] and Smurphy	R

232920	233760	Yeah.	id157		L			
233920	236120	Now, you're gonna touch that picture on your screen,	R
