30000	33000	So today, I'm going to have you play a matching game.	R					
33000	38000	But before we do that, I'm going to have you practice touching the iPads by popping some bubbles.	R					
38000	41000	So go ahead and press the blue button to start.	R					
41000	45000	And then just keep pressing the bubbles until there's none left.	R					
52000	55000	Yeah, because none left going mind bugging.	id259					
56000	58000	Oh, nice job.	R					
		You need to do	id259					
60000	62000	Oh, perfect.	R					
62000	64000	All right, let me take these back really quick.	R					
64000	67000	So I see you guys already saw our friend Smurphy.	R					
67000	69000	So this is Smurphy. Do you want to say hi?	R					
69000	71000	Hi.	id260					
		Hi Smurfy	id259					
71000	76000	All right, so, all right, let's sit back in our chairs right now.	R					
76000	80000	But we are going to help Smurphy.	R					
80000	83000	And Smurphy is going to need your help.	R					
83000	91000	So what's going to happen is that we're first going to see two pictures on your screen like this.	R					
91000	93000	So you're each going to see two pictures.	R					
93000	95000	I see an apple.	id259					
95000	96000	Yeah.	R					
96000	98000	I see a banana.	id260					
98000	99000	An apple and a banana?	R					
99000	100000	Yeah.	id260					
100000	101000	Yeah.	R					
101000	104000	And one of you is going to see a black box around with the pictures.	R					
104000	105000	A banana.	id259					
105000	108000	Yeah, see how the banana is inside the black box?	R					
108000	111000	So one of you is going to see two pictures with no black box.	R					
111000	114000	And one of you is going to see a picture with a black box.	R					
114000	117000	Now, if you see the black box, this means you're the teller.	R					
117000	120000	And you're going to help tell Smurphy what's in the black box.	R					
120000	122000	That's his job.	R					
122000	127000	Oh, something is, hey Smurphy, he's a banana in the black box.	id259					
127000	128000	Yes, exactly.	R					
128000	134000	And if you don't see a black box, you're going to be the guesser.	R					
134000	137000	And you're going to hold Smurphy and you're going to guess what's in the black box.	R					
137000	141000	So once you think you know what's in the black box, you can tap it.	R					
		Apple.	id259					
		Apple.	id260					
141000	144000	You can tap it like this on the iPad.	R					
144000	146000	Yes.	R					
146000	148000	Yes, exactly.	R					
148000	153000	Now, let's sit back down in our chair's friends.	R					
153000	156000	Oh, I'm sorry, not yet.	R					
156000	159000	I'm going to finish explaining the game first, okay?	R					
159000	164000	So if you see a black box, what are we going to do?	R					
164000	165000	Tell Smurphy.	id259					
165000	167000	You're going to tell Smurphy what you see in the black box, right?	R					
167000	168000	Banana.	id259					
168000	169000	Exactly.	R					
169000	172000	And if you don't see a black box, what are you going to do?	R					
172000	175000	Guess what's in the black box.	id259					
175000	178000	Yes, guess what's in the black box.	R					
		Apple.	id260					
178000	182000	Now, if you guess correctly, you're going to see a happy face.	R					
182000	185000	But if you guess incorrectly, you're going to see a sad face.	R					
185000	189000	But that's okay, because we're going to have lots of turns to help Smurphy.	R					
189000	196000	And we're going to keep taking turns of helping him and telling him what's in the box.	R					
196000	197000	Does that sound good?	R					
197000	198000	Yes.	id259					
198000	200000	All right, he gets started.	R
