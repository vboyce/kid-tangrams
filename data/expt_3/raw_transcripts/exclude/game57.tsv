0	9760	Okay, cool. Alrighty, so today we're gonna play a fun little matching game, but before we do that	R					
9760	13680	we're gonna get used to using the iPads. So if you want you can press the blue button to get	R					
13680	18980	started, and then, and then just have all the bubbles make them pop.	R					
19980	26980	All of them?	id215					
		 Yep. Just pop those. 	R					
		Or the match ones.	id215					
		 All of them, just every bubble you see.	R					
28980	31980	But I did it. 	id216					
		Yeah, and then keep going, did more bubbles.	R					
34980	39980	I popped them. 	id215					
		Wow, you're doing great. 	R					
		I have to pop them again.	id215					
		 Yeah, I keep going.	R					
40980	44980	Oh, shhh, let's wait for it. Let's wait for it to keep it in the other finish.	R					
48980	53980	Nice. Okay, so now you see this guy on your screen. So this guy's name is Smurphy.	R					
53980	56980	Do you want to say hi Smurphy? Hi.	R					
57980	63980	Anyway, so in this game we're gonna be helping Smurphy to guess between two shapes that you see on the screen.	R					
63980	69980	So if you see a black box on your screen, then that means that you're gonna be the teller,	R					
69980	76980	and you're gonna tell Smurphy what you see inside the black box. So what you see inside right here.	R					
76980	81980	I don't see a black box. 	id215					
		Oh yeah, you'll see it once we start the game.	R					
81980	84980	So I'm just trying to explain the rules right now. 	R					
		I have to start it again.	id215					
84980	90980	Oh, well this is gonna be for the start of the actual game, but I'll tell you when we're gonna press play, okay?	R					
90980	96980	Yeah, let's keep our iPads facing each other, and then I'll tell you when to start.	R					
96980	102980	Okay, so if you see the black box, you're gonna be the teller,	R					
102980	104980	and you're gonna tell them what you see inside the black box.	R					
104980	107980	And if you're the one holding Smurphy, that means you're the guesser,	R					
107980	111980	and you're gonna guess which shape it is from what the teller tells you.	R					
111980	116980	And when you think you know the right answer, you're gonna tap the answer you think it is.	R					
116980	120980	And if you get it right, you'll see a smiley face, and if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
120980	123980	But that's okay, because you'll have a lot of chances to help Smurphy.	R					
123980	129980	So hope, and then, so just to remember, if you have the black box, what are you gonna do?	R					
129980	131980	The big...	id215					
132980	134980	The...	id215					
134980	138980	No, you're gonna be the teller, so you're gonna tell them what you see inside the black box.	R					
138980	142980	And if you're the one holding Smurphy, what are you gonna do?	R					
142980	145980	You're gonna get the guesser.	R					
145980	148980	You're gonna be the guesser, so you're gonna click the answer you think it is.	R					
148980	153980	So, if you have the black box, what are you gonna do?	R					
153980	155980	The teller.	id215					
155980	157980	So you're gonna tell them what you see inside the black box.	R					
157980	159980	And if you're holding Smurphy...	R					
163980	166980	They can click the answer.	id216					
166980	167980	Yeah, you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
167980	169980	So you're gonna guess which one you think it is.	R					
169980	171980	And then tap the answer you want to know.	R					
171980	172980	Okay?	R					
172980	174980	Okay, I think you guys are ready to start.	R					
174980	177980	Okay, so if you wanna click the blue buttons to get started.	R					
179980	181980	Alright, so which one of you has the black box?	R	1				
181980	184980	Oh, okay, so make sure you keep it facing yourself.	R					
184980	187980	So, that means you're gonna be the teller and you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
187980	188980	So you get to hold Smurphy.	R					
188980	193980	And so, now [id215], can you tell [id216] what you see inside the black box?	R					
193980	196980	There's a banana in the black box.	id215		S		a banana	Y
196980	201980	Okay, and then [id216], when you have a guess, then you can just tap the screen of which one you think it is.	R					
203980	206980	Yeah, just like that, that's perfect.	R	2				
206980	208980	I got a happy face.	id216		S			
208980	211980	I got a happy face also.	id215		L			
211980	215980	Yeah, so now we're gonna switch and now you're gonna be the teller and you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
215980	219980	So [id216], could you tell [id215] what you see inside the black box?	R

229980	231980	I got a happy face.	id216		L			
231980	232980	So that's how you play the game.	R					
232980	236980	So now we're gonna keep going back and forth and you're gonna be the teller and you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
237980	242980	There's a star in the black box.	id215		S		a star	Y
244980	247980	Make sure you stay right in front of the iPad, so stay in the middle of your seat.	R					
248980	252980	Okay, and then so [id216], when you have a guess, then you can just click the answer you think it is.	R

413980	414980	It was the other one.	R					
414980	419980	So maybe we should try using a little bit more words to try to help the other person	R					
419980	421980	since we've gotten a couple of them wrong now.	R					
421980	422980	Okay.	R
