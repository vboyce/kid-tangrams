0	9600	Hi! Okay, you guys are now on camera. Thank you so much, [id163], and [id164] for playing my game.	R					
9600	11600	Yeah, and I was not working around.	id164					
11600	18600	Yeah, the iPads weren't working, but now they're working. So, today we're going to play a really fun matching game. Are you guys ready?	R					
18600	19800	Yeah!	id164					
19800	25600	But before that, we're going to play a really fun bubble popping game to practice touching our iPads, okay?	R					
25600	34600	So, you're going to start by pressing the blue button in the middle of your screen, and then you're going to touch all of the bubbles that you see on your iPad to make them pop, okay?	R					
34600	35600	Right.	id164					
35600	36600	Good job!	R					
36600	39600	Mine is, I'm pressing it and it’s not working.	id163

44600	46600	broken ipad.	id163					
46600	49600	Here, so sorry, let me see.	R					
50600	54600	Here, hang on [id164], one sec. Hold on, I'm so sorry.	R					
55600	57600	Let me see.	R					
61600	63600	That's so weird.	R					
64600	69600	Here, just one second, because you guys have to play at the same time. That's super weird.	R					
71600	74600	I wonder if like, why can't we share?	id164					
74600	80600	It has to be, each of you guys using one iPad. Let me try and run it again, and then...	R					
86600	90600	Okay, there you go. Okay, keep going, [id163]. I'm so sorry about that.	R					
90600	94600	You guys can keep touching the bubbles on your iPads, [id163] and [id164].	R					
95600	99600	Yeah, sometimes it's a little bit hard. You just have to touch it really hard, okay?	R					
103600	105600	Like, just touch it.	R					
108600	110600	There we go, just touch it.	R					
110600	111600	Yay there’s Smurfy!	R					
111600	112600	Good job!	R					
112600	116600	Okay, now I'm going to explain the matching game to you guys. Thank you so much.	R					
116600	119600	You did so well touching the bubbles to make them pop.	R					
119600	124600	So, in this game, we're going to help our friend, Smurphy. Do you want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
124600	126600	Hi, [id163], hi, [id164].	R					
126600	131600	So, in this matching game, we're going to help Smurphy guess some pictures.	R					
131600	136600	So, each of your iPads on your screens, you're going to see these two pictures, okay?	R					
136600	141600	But one of you will see a square behind one of your pictures, and one of you will not.	R					
141600	145600	If you see the black box around your picture, that means that you're the teller.	R					
145600	150600	And you're going to tell Smurphy which one of the pictures has the black box around it.	R					
150600	153600	If you're holding Smurphy, that means you're the guesser.	R					
153600	158600	And you're going to help Smurphy guess which one of the pictures has the black box around it, okay?	R					
158600	161600	If you guess right, you're going to see a happy face.	R					
161600	164600	If you guess wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
164600	168600	But that's okay, because you have lots of chances to help Smurphy guess which picture has the box around it.	R					
168600	170600	A happy face.	id164					
170600	172600	That's a happy face, yes it is.	R					
172600	177600	Okay, so once again, just to recap, if you see the black box, what's your job?	R					
177600	180600	You're the teller.	R					
180600	182600	So, you're going to tell Smurphy what you see.	R					
182600	185600	And if you're holding Smurphy, this is what you're going to see on your screen.	R					
185600	186600	And you're the guesser.	R					
186600	191600	And you have to touch which picture has the black box around it based on what your friend tells you, okay?	R					
191600	193600	You ready to play?	R					
193600	194600	This is on the table.	id163
