9000	16000	How are we doing today? Doing good. Thank you. Okay, so today we're going to play a really fun matching game.	R					
16000	24000	Are you guys ready? Okay, but first we're going to practice touching our iPads by playing a really fun bubble popping game.	R					
24000	30000	You guys like popping bubbles? Okay, so you're going to just touch all the bubbles on your iPads to make them pop.	R					
30000	34000	And you're going to start by pressing the blue button in the middle of the screen. You guys ready?	R					
34000	40000	Okay, you can touch it now. Go ahead, you can touch all the bubbles to make them pop.	R					
40000	50000	Good job. Good job. Keep doing it. Keep popping them until you're gone.	R					
50000	60000	Good job, [id153]. Good job, [id154]. Okay, really good job popping the bubbles.	R					
60000	63000	Now I'm going to explain the matching game. Are you guys ready?	R					
63000	69000	Okay, so in the game we're going to help our friend Smurfy. Do you guys want to say hi to Smurfy?	R					
69000	78000	Hi, [id153]. 	R					
		Hi Smurfy.	id153					
		Hi, [id154]. Okay, so in the game you both are going to see on your screens pictures.	R					
78000	83000	And one of you is going to see a black box around one of your pictures.	R					
83000	91000	If you have the black box around one of your pictures, that means we need to tell Smurfy which one of the pictures is in the black box.	R					
91000	96000	Okay, so if you see on your screen a black box around one of your pictures, that means you're the teller.	R					
96000	104000	And you're going to tell Smurfy what you see. If you're the person who's holding Smurfy, that means you're not going to see any black boxes on your screen.	R					
104000	111000	And that means that you're the guesser. And so you're going to help Smurfy guess which picture has the black box around it.	R					
111000	116000	Okay? If you and Smurfy guess the picture right, you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
116000	125000	If you guys guess the picture wrong, you'll see a frowny face. But that's okay because you'll have lots of chances to help Smurfy guess which picture has the blocks around it.	R					
125000	133000	Okay? So we're going to take turns guessing and telling. So if you have the black box around your picture, do you remember what we're going to do?	R

138000	146000	And if you're holding Smurfy, that means you're the guesser. And you're going to guess which picture has the box around it.	R					
146000	152000	Okay? Are we ready to play? Okay. You can both tap on the blue box to start.	R					
152000	158000	And we'll see. Oh, it's time to start. Who has the black box around one of their pictures?	R
