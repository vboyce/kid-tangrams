28800	31600	Okay, so in this game, we're gonna, it's gonna be a matching game.	R					
31600	34400	But before we do that, we're gonna get used to using the iPads.	R					
34400	38600	So if you guys can click the blue button to start, and then just click all the bubbles	R					
38600	39600	to pop them.	R					
39600	40600	Which, which color?	id176					
40600	41600	All, all the bubbles.	R					
41600	42600	Just pop all of them.	R					
42600	43600	Red, and blue, and pink?	id175					
43600	44600	Yeah.	R					
44600	45600	All the, all the bubbles.	R					
45600	46600	Any bubble you want.	R					
46600	47600	All of them!	id176					
47600	48600	Yeah.	R					
48600	49600	And just keep going.	R					
49600	50600	Keep popping.	R					
50600	51600	Oh.	R					
51600	52600	Awesome.	R					
52600	56600	And now let's wait for [id175] to finish.	R					
56600	57600	Nice.	R					
57600	58600	Okay.	R					
58600	59600	What is this?	id175					
59600	60600	This dog!	id175					
60600	61600	Yeah.	R					
61600	62600	He's right here.	R					
62600	63600	So in this game, we're gonna be helping Smurfy.	R					
63600	64600	And this is Smurfy.	R					
64600	65600	Do you want to say hi?	R					
65600	66600	Hi.	id176					
66600	67600	Hi.	id175					
67600	68600	Yeah, okay.	R					
68600	72600	Okay, so Smurfy's job is to try to guess between the two pictures that you're gonna	R					
72600	73600	see on your iPads.	R					
73600	75600	And so you guys are gonna be helping him.	R					
75600	80600	So if you see on your screen that there's a black box around you, and you're gonna	R					
80600	81600	be helping him.	R					
81600	87600	So if you see on your screen that there's a black box around one of the pictures, that	R					
87600	89600	means that you are gonna be the teller.	R					
89600	93600	And so you are gonna be telling the other person what you see in the black box.	R					
93600	94600	What again?	id175					
94600	96600	Oh, don't press the button yet.	R					
96600	98600	Until I'm done explaining the instructions.	R					
98600	101600	So if you see a black box, then you are gonna be the teller.	R					
101600	103600	And you are gonna tell Smurfy.	R					
103600	105600	Why is beginning again?	id175					
105600	107600	Well, it's gonna start the new game now.	R					
107600	111600	Because that other game was just a practice, just to figure out how to touch the iPad.	R					
111600	113600	Okay, so pay attention.	R					
113600	116600	So this one, if you see the black box, you're the teller.	R					
116600	117600	Okay.	R					
117600	121600	And then otherwise, you're gonna be holding Smurfy, and that means that you're the guesser.	R					
121600	125600	And so if you're the guesser, then you are gonna try to figure out which shape the other	R					
125600	127600	person is trying to tell you about.	R					
127600	128600	Yeah.	R					
128600	129600	Okay.	id176					
129600	134600	So if the teller was holding this one, then you would think that it's like, oh, then	R					
134600	136600	that's a banana, right?	R					
136600	140600	And then, so then you would touch the banana, because you're the guesser.	R					
140600	141600	Yeah.	R					
141600	142600	Okay.	R					
142600	145600	And if you get it wrong as the guesser, or if you get it right as the guesser, then you're	R					
145600	146600	gonna see a smiley face.	R					
146600	148600	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
148600	151600	But that's okay, because there's gonna be a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
151600	152600	Okay.	R					
152600	159600	So if you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
159600	161600	Just touch the banana.	id175					
161600	162600	No, no, no.	R					
162600	164600	If you see the black box, you're gonna be the teller.	R					
164600	165600	You're just gonna tell the other person.	R					
165600	166600	You're not gonna tap anything.	R					
166600	167600	Yes.	id175					
167600	168600	Yeah.	R					
168600	173600	And then if you're holding Smurfy, what are you gonna do?	R					
173600	174600	Guess.	id176					
174600	175600	Yes.	R					
175600	176600	Guess.	R					
176600	178600	And then you're gonna touch the iPad of which one you think that it is.	R					
178600	179600	Okay.	R					
179600	180600	And then you guys are ready to play.	R					
180600	181600	Okay.	R					
181600	184600	So if you guys can click the first button.	R					
184600	185600	This one?	id175					
185600	186600	Mm-hmm.	R					
186600	187600	The blue one?	id176					
187600	188600	Ah!	R					
188600	189600	All right.	R					
189600	190600	So who is the black box?	R	1				
190600	191600	That was loud.	id175		L			
191600	192600	Yeah.	R					
192600	193600	Who is the black box right now?	R					
193600	194600	Me.	id176		S			
194600	195600	You have it?	R					
195600	196600	Okay.	R					
196600	197600	The banana.	id175		L			x
197600	199600	Well, no, because you don't have the black box.	R					
199600	202600	So you gotta wait for, um, wait for, um...	R					
202600	203600	The banana!	id176		S		the banana	
204600	205600	Yes.	id175		L			
205600	206600	Okay.	R					
206600	207600	So you're the guesser.	R					
207600	216600	And then so now, since you're the guesser, then you'll click what you think it is.	R					
216600	221600	So if [id176] said that it's the banana, then you'll touch the one that you think it is.	R			x		
221600	222600	Banana.	id175		L			x
222600	223600	And then you'll tap the screen.	R					
223600	224600	Yes!	R					
224600	225600	Nice.	R					
225600	226600	Okay.	R					
226600	227600	So...	id175		L			
227600	228600	Good job.	R	2				
228600	229600	And so now you're going to be the guesser now.	R					
229600	230600	And now you're the teller.	R					
230600	232600	Um, is it dog?	id175		S			
232600	233600	Oh, tell [id176].	R					
233600	234600	Um...	R					
234600	237600	So tell [id176] what you see in the black box.	R

241600	242600	Nice.	R					
242600	243600	Okay.	R	3				
243600	245600	And now we're going to switch back.	R					
245600	248600	And now you're going to be the guesser.	R					
248600	251600	And you're going to be the teller.	R					
251600	252600	I have it.	id176		S			
252600	255600	So can you tell [id175] what you see inside?	R

267600	268600	It looks...	id176		S			
268600	270600	In this game we use our words to explain it.	R					
270600	272600	So keep your iPad facing you.	R					
272600	274600	I just wanted to show you.	id176		S

321600	322600	Okay.	id175		L			
322600	326600	I don't know what it should be because this is hard.	id175		L

331600	335600	So do you want to ask [id176] a quick question about which one it is?	R					
335600	337600	It's one on this side.	id176		S			
337600	340600	Oh, well it won't be on the same side for the...	R					
340600	346600	So you just have to describe, like explain what it looks like.	R					
346600	347600	It looks...	id176		S			
347600	350600	It kind of looks like a...	id176		S			
350600	354600	It's not a circle with the points.	id176		S		not a circle with the points	
354600	357600	It's the other one.	id176		S			
357600	364600	We did this side but I don't know what this side is working.	id175		L			
364600	367600	It doesn't matter.	id176		S			
367600	371600	Yeah, you just tap whichever one that you think that he's describing.	R					
371600	374600	The one that he's trying to tell you about.	R					
374600	376600	Yeah, just take your best guess.	R					
376600	378600	Maybe this one.	id175		L			
378600	379600	Okay, just stop it.	R					
379600	381600	Take your best guess.	R					
381600	383600	Okay, so it was the other one but that's okay.	R	4

459600	460600	It's random.	R

599600	601600	And then they go this way.	id176		S		they go this way	
601600	603600	And then they go up.	id176		S		they go up	
603600	605600	And then they go down that way.	id176		S		they go way down that way

612600	614600	I don't know if that's really helping [id175].	R			x		
614600	616600	Okay, [id175], do you want to take your best guess?	R					
616600	617600	And just tap the screen?	R					
617600	622600	Maybe this is like a square and a half and has a square.	id175		L		square and a half and has a square	x
622600	623600	Well, you're just guessing.	R					
623600	626600	So you're just going to listen to what he tells you.	R					
626600	627600	I don't know.	id175		L			
627600	628600	Yeah.	R					
628600	629600	It's okay.	R					
629600	630600	It's okay.	R

633600	634600	No.	R					
634600	635600	You're just tap the screen.	R					
635600	637600	Whichever one you think it is.	R					
637600	643600	She's definitely the one on the square on the back.	id176		S			
643600	644600	This one.	id175		L			
644600	647600	Okay, try it.	R					
647600	648600	Just tap it.	R					
648600	649600	It's okay.	R					
649600	650600	Just tap it.	R					
650600	653600	Because I guess it's no.	id175		L			
653600	654600	It's okay.	R					
654600	656600	Just tap it and see.	R					
656600	659600	There's going to be a lot of more chances to go back and forth.	R					
659600	660600	So don't worry about it.	R					
660600	661600	Just tap.	R					
661600	662600	Tap.	R					
662600	663600	It's okay.	R					
663600	664600	Yeah.	R					
664600	669600	Just take your best guess.	R					
669600	674600	You have to tap a little harder.	R					
679600	682600	Just do it.	id176		S			
682600	683600	No.	id175		L			
683600	684600	Okay.	R					
684600	686600	So that was the other one.	R					
686600	687600	But that's totally okay.	R					
687600	688600	We'll have more chances.	R	6				
688600	689600	I know.	id176		L			
689600	692600	I know you're going to be the teller.	R					
692600	693600	She's so cute.	id176		L

696600	699600	[id175], could you tell [id176] what you see inside?	R

705600	708600	So you're just going to listen.	R					
708600	718600	This is like a	id175		S			
		is it a good guess for you?	id176		L			
718600	724600	It's a, I know how to do this game with the box, but I don't know what it is.	id175		S			
724600	727600	It has no box.	id175		S			
727600	728600	Yeah.	R					
728600	730600	Can you just say what's like inside the box?	R					
730600	732600	What that thing is?	R					
732600	734600	Listen to [id175].	R					
734600	736600	Listen to [id175].	R					
736600	737600	He's confused.	id176		L			
737600	744600	I know, but he'll be less confused if you listen to [id175].	R					
744600	749600	It has a diamond at the top, like a face.	id175		S		a diamond at the top like a face	
749600	751600	It has a whole body.	id175		S		a whole body

759600	762600	It's a little like a pointy.	id175		S

767600	769600	Well, he can't see what you're pointing at.	R					
769600	772600	Is there a way you can tell him what it looks like with your words?	R					
772600	774600	Let's touch the box.	id175		S			
774600	776600	Well, but he doesn't have the box.	R					
776600	781600	So you have to try to help him know which one that you see inside the box.	R					
781600	787600	I don't really know what it is, but I'll take a good guess.	id176		L			
787600	788600	Okay.	R					
788600	790600	Then yeah, you can just take your best guess.	R					
790600	794600	I think it's this one.	id176		L			
794600	795600	Just press it.	id176		L			
795600	796600	Yeah.	R

805600	806600	Here you go, [id175].	R					
806600	808600	So now it's your turn to guess.	R					
808600	810600	So can you describe it?	R					
810600	812600	Do you think to press it?	id176		S			
812600	813600	Can I press it?	id176		S			
813600	814600	You don't press.	R					
814600	817600	Right now you're the teller because you have the black box.	R					
817600	821600	Oh, why is there the same thing as earlier?	id176		S			
821600	824600	It just, there's only a couple of shapes, but yeah.	R

835600	837600	The one on this side.	id176		S			
837600	840600	It's not on the same side for each person.	R					
840600	843600	So that doesn't help her.	R					
843600	844600	It's such a bunch of poo.	id176		S			
844600	846600	But that's just how the game works.	R					
846600	847600	No, it's not.	id176		S			
847600	848600	It's not.	id176		S			
848600	849600	It's not.	id176		S			
849600	850600	It's not.	id176		S

		Itâ€™s a boot	id176		S			
860600	861600	Okay.	R					
861600	864600	So [id175], do you want to take your best guess?	R					
864600	865600	No.	id175		L			
865600	868600	I don't know what it is.	id175		L			
868600	869600	It's okay if you don't know.	R					
869600	874600	Just take your best guess.	id176		S			
874600	878600	[id176], could you tell her more about it?	R					
878600	880600	Besides just that, it's a boot.	R			x		
880600	881600	Can you tell her more?	R					
881600	882600	itâ€™s a boot	id176		S			
882600	883600	It's not.	R					
883600	885600	But that's not enough for her to know.	R					
885600	887360	We're here to know, so could you tell her more?	R					
887360	888920	That was funny.	id175		L

902000	903000	He's giving you, he's telling you a lot about it.	R					
903000	904000	I don't know.	id175		L			
904000	905000	But, you just do it!	id176		S			
907000	919000	Then you can just take your best guess, it's okay, [id175].	R					
919000	923000	Don't do that!	id176		S			
923000	927000	It's a boot!	id176		S			
927000	929000	I don't know.	id175		L

955000	958000	I just want to watch...	id175		L			
958000	964000	I just want to watch this game, but I don't know what its answer is.	id175		L			
964000	969000	Because I play any games, no games.	id175		L			
969000	970000	It's okay.	R					
970000	975000	Because I can't solve...	id176		S			
975000	977000	I just don't...	id176		S

1446000	1448000	I think I have...	id176		L			
1448000	1449000	Right now, you're the guesser.	R

1465000	1466000	You want to stop playing the game?	R					
1466000	1467000	Me too.	id175		S			
1467000	1468000	Okay, then that's okay.	R					
1468000	1470000	Then maybe let's keep going.	id175		S			
1470000	1472000	Do you want to keep going?	R					
1472000	1474000	A little bit.	id176		L			
1474000	1475000	Okay, then let's keep going	R					
1475000	1476000	for a little bit more.	R					
1476000	1477000	And if you ever want to stop,	R					
1477000	1479000	then we can go back to the classroom, okay?	R					
1479000	1480000	Okay.	id176		L			
1480000	1482000	Okay, so then [id175],	R					
1482000	1483000	could you tell [id176]	R					
1483000	1484000	what you see in the black box?	R					
1484000	1486000	How long is this game?	id176		L			
1486000	1487000	It's...	R					
1487000	1488000	I don't think there's that many more left.	R					
1488000	1489000	It's just a couple of...	R					
1489000	1490000	What is it, 15?	id175		S			
1490000	1492000	Yeah, it's usually for about 15 minutes.	R

1498000	1499000	No.	id175		S			
1499000	1500000	I don't want 15.	id175		S			
1500000	1502000	It's probably like five more minutes.	R					
1502000	1503000	15 games.	id176		L			
1503000	1505000	This is all going to take forever.	id176		L			
1505000	1507000	I want one minute.	id175		S			
1507000	1509000	Well, it'll take a little bit longer	R
