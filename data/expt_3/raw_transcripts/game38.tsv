33100	34500	Can you sit all the way in your chair, please?	R					
35000	35500	Thank you.	R					
35900	38800	And then, now just touch the screen to pop all the bubbles.	R

44000	45800	I'll pop all the bubbles.	id184

50700	51200	Nice.	R					
51600	53000	Now let’s wait for [id183] to finish.	R					
58700	59200	Good job.	R					
59400	60000	Okay, cool.	R					
60400	63300	Um, so now I'm going to explain the game.	R					
63300	64700	Oh, let's not turn our iPads.	R					
65100	67000	Um, so now I'm going to explain the game.	R					
67400	69900	So in this game, you're going to be helping Smurphy.	R					
70100	70800	This is Smurphy.	R					
71100	71700	Do you want to say hi?	R					
		hi	id184					
73900	79200	So Smurphy's job is to try to guess what shapes are on the screen.	R					
79700	85100	So if you see a black box on your screen, then you are going to be the teller	R					
85600	87700	and you are going to, oh, look at this down.	R					
88000	92000	You're going to be the teller and you are going to tell Smurphy what you see	R					
92000	93000	in the black box.	R					
94500	98200	And if you are the one holding Smurphy, then you are going to be the	R					
98200	102700	guesser and you're going to try to guess what's in the black box after the	R					
102700	105700	teller tells you what they see in the box.	R					
106500	107000	Okay.	R					
107000	110500	I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't, I thought.	id184					
111200	111700	What?	R					
111700	112400	I thought.	id184					
112900	113400	I thought?	R					
113900	114700	No, I thought.	id184					
115200	115700	I thought.	R					
118700	122200	Anyway, wait, let's listen to the instructions so we can play the game.	R					
122200	122600	Okay.	R					
123200	127100	So yeah, if you are the one holding Smurphy, you're going to be the guesser	R					
127300	131600	and if you get it right, then you'll see a smiley face and if you get it wrong,	R					
131600	134600	you'll see a frowny face, but that's okay because you'll have a lot more	R					
134600	135500	chances to help Smurphy.	R					
136900	137300	Yeah.	id184					
138200	138600	Okay.	R					
138800	142800	So just to remember, if you, oh wait, don't touch that one yet.	R					
143400	147100	So if you see it, if you see the black box, what are you going to do?	R					
148000	148700	Guessing.	id184					
149000	150200	No, you're going to be the teller.	R					
150400	153200	So you're going to tell Smurphy what you see in the black box.	R					
		is that a banana?	id183					
153800	158000	And if, yeah, it is.	R					
158200	161900	And then so if you're the guesser or if you are the one holding Smurphy,	R
