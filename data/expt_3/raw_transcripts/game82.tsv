0	18320	So today we're going	R					
18320	25640	to play a fun matching game. But before we do that, we're going to practice touching our	R					
25640	31720	iPads by playing a little game of popping bubbles. Okay. So press the blue button on	R					
31720	45920	your screen and then pop all the bubbles. Great job. And then keep popping. Yeah, just	R					
45920	53000	press and then release. Awesome tone. Let's just wait for [id250] to finish. It can be	R					
53000	60760	gentle like that even. Awesome. So today I'm super excited you guys. We're going to help	R					
60760	67800	Smurphy. This is Smurphy. Do you guys want to say hi?  	R					
		Hi.	id249					
		Smurphy says hi back. So each	R					
67800	73960	of you on your screen is going to see two boxes. Sorry, two shapes. And one of the shapes	R					
73960	80880	will be surrounded by a black box. And your job is to help Smurphy guess which picture	R					
80880	90760	is inside the black box. 	R					
		banana	id250					
		Exactly. So if you do see a black box on your screen, then you	R					
90760	98400	are the teller. And your job is to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box. If you're	R					
98400	104560	holding Smurphy and you don't see a black box, then you are the guesser. And your job	R					
104560	111080	is to help Smurphy guess which picture is in the black box. When you think you know	R					
111080	118640	which picture is, you're just going to touch that picture on your screen. If you get it	R					
118640	124600	right, you'll see a smiley face. If you don't, you'll get a frowny face. But that's okay	R					
124600	130840	because Smurphy has a lot more chances. We're going to take turns guessing and telling.	R					
130840	139040	So little quiz. If you see the black box, what do you do? 	R					
		tell	id249					
		Yeah, you're going to tell	R					
139040	145920	Smurphy which picture is in the black box. And if you're holding Smurphy and you don't	R					
145920	155440	see a black box, what should you do? 	R					
		it’s okay	id249					
		Yeah, you're going to guess. So you're	R					
155440	161400	going to tap whichever picture you think it is. Does that make sense?						
		Yes	id249					
		Yes	id250					
161400	169480	Alright, Let's begin. Tap the blue thing on your screen. Which of you sees a black box?  	R	1
