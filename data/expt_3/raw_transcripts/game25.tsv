0	2000	What animal is this?	id169					
2000	4000	What do you think it is?	R					
4000	5600	It looks like a dog.	id169					
5600	7400	Yeah, I think so too.	R					
7400	11080	OK, so today we're going to play a fun matching game.	R					
11080	12800	But before we do that, we're going	R					
12800	15040	to get used to using the iPads.	R					
15040	17480	So if you guys can start by clicking the blue button,	R					
17480	18920	saw that?	R					
18920	19920	Nice.	R					
19920	21920	And then so first, just click all the bubbles	R					
21920	23800	to make them pop until you don't see anymore.	R					
23800	25960	OK.	id170					
25960	28000	Yep.	R					
28000	29120	Yeah?	R					
29120	30680	I'm done with mine.	id169					
30680	32440	Now I'm done with you.	id170					
32440	32940	Yep.	R					
32940	36040	And then there's more bubbles.	R					
36040	36540	Good job.	R					
36540	38040	And now we're going to wait for.	R					
38040	39040	Yep.	R					
39040	41000	This is what my did.	id170					
41000	41680	Nice.	R					
41680	42920	Yeah?	R					
42920	44120	That's Murphy.	R					
44120	45040	He's right here.	R					
45040	46840	All right, so now I'm going to explain the game.	R					
46840	47880	So this is Murphy.	R					
47880	49600	And the goal of the game is to help him guess.	R					
49600	50960	Do you want to say hi to Murphy?	R					
50960	51720	Hi.	id170					
51720	53120	Hi, Murphy.	id169					
53120	53680	Yeah.	R					
53680	54440	OK.	R					
54440	57800	So the goal of the game is to help Murphy guess	R					
57840	59160	between two pictures.	R					
59160	61880	So on your screens, you're going to see two pictures,	R					
61880	63800	just like this, or like this one.	R					
63800	67400	And if you see a black box around one of the pictures,	R					
67400	68960	then you are going to be the teller.	R					
68960	72480	And you're going to tell Murphy what you see in the black box.	R					
72480	74240	So if you saw this one, then you'd	R					
74240	77200	be saying that you see the banana in the square.	R					
77200	77700	Yeah.	R					
77700	78280	It's very visible.	R					
78280	79320	Not yet.	R					
79320	81280	I'll tell you when to press it.	R					
81280	84000	So yeah, if you see the black box, you're the teller.	R					
84000	87780	And otherwise, the other person is going to be holding Murphy.	R					
87780	89700	And if you're holding Murphy, then you	R					
89700	90900	are going to be the guesser.	R					
90900	93140	And you have to guess what is in the black box,	R					
93140	95700	based on what the other person tells you.	R					
95700	99260	So if you're holding Murphy, you're going to be the guesser.	R					
99260	100500	Yeah.	R					
100500	102780	And if you get it right when you're guessing,	R					
102780	103980	then you'll see a smiley face.	R					
103980	105820	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
105820	107660	But that's tot[id170] OK, because there's	R					
107660	110140	going to be a lot of chances to help Murphy.	R					
110140	114660	So just to remember, if you see the black box,	R					
114660	115860	what are you going to do?	R					
118740	119740	Remind.	id169					
119740	120260	What?	R					
120260	121700	Remind.	id169					
121700	121980	Yeah.	R					
121980	123540	So if you see the black box, then you	R					
123540	126100	are going to be the one telling the other person what	R					
126100	127820	you see in the black box.	R					
127820	129140	So you're going to be the teller.	R					
129140	130460	Can I hit the blue button?	id170					
130460	131620	In one second.	R					
131620	136140	And then if you're holding Murphy, what are you going to do?	R					
136140	137380	Hey, the teller.	id169					
137380	138940	You're going to be the guesser.	R					
138940	141500	So if you're holding Murphy, you're going to be the guesser.	R					
141500	144100	And if you see the black box on your screen,	R					
144100	146180	then you are going to be the teller.	R					
146180	146980	Yeah.	R					
146980	147700	OK.	R					
147740	149420	And you guys are ready, then.	R					
149420	151100	OK, so you guys can click the blue button.	R					
154900	157020	And so who has the black box?	R	1				
157020	157660	Not me.	id170		L			
157660	158220	I do.	id169		S			
158220	158780	OK.	R					
158780	160940	So that means that you are going to be the guesser.	R					
160940	163060	So you get Murphy.	R					
163060	165620	And this one is the apple.	id169		S		the apple	
165620	166020	OK.	R					
166020	168820	So then now you guess by touching your screen,	R					
168820	171860	which one that you think is the apple.	R			x		
171860	172660	Yes.	R					
172660	173340	Nice.	R	2				
173340	173620	All right.	R					
173620	174500	And now we're going to switch.	R					
174500	175900	So now you're going to have the black box,	R					
175900	177380	and you're going to have Murphy.	R					
177420	178460	So you're going to be the teller.	R					
178460	180820	Oh, I have the dog with the box.	id170		S		the dog	
180820	181100	Yeah.	R					
181100	183060	So what do you see inside the box?	R					
183060	186180	A dog.	id170		S		a dog	
186180	189860	So now you're going to click your screen based on what	R					
189860	190700	[id170] just said.	R					
190700	192780	This one?	R					
192780	195340	Just take your best guess based on what she just said.	R					
195340	196820	The dog.	id169		L		the dog	x
196820	198860	Do you want to ask her?	R					
198860	199780	Ask [id170].	R					
199780	202740	Do you want to ask [id170] a question about what you see?	R					
202740	207300	I see a dog and a bird.	id169		S			
		a bird	id170		L			
207980	208260	Yeah.	R					
208260	211340	So which one has the box around it?	R					
211340	212580	Mine.	id170		L			
212580	212860	Oh, yeah.	R					
212860	213980	But what's inside the box?	R					
213980	217420	Because you're trying to describe what's in the box to [id169].	R					
217420	219060	Oh, a dog.	id170		L			
219060	220380	OK.	R					
220380	222940	It's a dog, isn't it?	id170					
222940	224540	So then click the answer that you think it is.	R					
228140	229020	Oh, OK.	R					
229020	230740	So we'll have more chances to help.	R	3				
230740	233700	But so you're trying to click on the one that you think that.	R					
233700	237140	Oh, I don't have the clue on mine then.	id170		L			
237180	239500	Yeah, so now you're the guesser, you're going to ask Murphy,	R					
239500	240900	and you're going to be the teller.	R					
240900	243580	So now describe what's in the box.	R					
243580	247380	Or tell [id170] what's inside.	R					
247380	248220	Oh, OK.	R					
248220	250740	So we've got to wait until, here, can I have Murphy back?	R	4				
250740	253540	So you've got to wait until the person with the box	R					
253540	256980	gives a description, and then you click, OK?	R					
256980	258940	I got the one with the box.	id170		S			
258940	259580	OK.	R					
259580	262940	So now you're going to wait for a description from [id170],	R					
262940	264740	and then you're going to click which one you think it is.	R					
264740	266140	Can I click this?	id170		S			
266140	268220	No, no, no, you're the teller right now.	R					
268220	272220	So you're going to tell [id169] what you think you see in the box.	R					
272220	274820	OK.	R					
274820	277820	I don't know what that is.	id170		S			
277820	279100	Just give me your best shot.	R					
289180	291340	Just, oh, you can't look at it.	R					
291340	292780	You're going to use our words in this game	R					
292780	295940	to try to describe what's on the screen.	R					
296940	299500	Does it look like anything?	R					
299500	300540	Anything that you know of?	R					
300540	303980	Or can you describe it with any, like, shapes?	R			x		
303980	306620	Or did it look like anything else?	R					
311460	313660	Well, you've got to help Murphy and help [id169] guess,	R					
313660	315540	because otherwise they won't know anything.	R					
315540	317580	I don't know what it is.	id170		S			
317580	319700	Yeah, but you just have to describe it.	R					
319700	321060	You don't have to know what it is.	R					
321060	323540	It can just be any description about it.	R					
326940	328940	A window?	id170		S		a window	
328940	330940	It looks like a window.	R			x		
330940	331940	Yeah.	R					
331940	333940	OK.	R					
333940	335940	If you think you know what it is, then you can try taking a guess.	R					
335940	339940	Or you can ask [id170] more questions about it.	R					
339940	342940	Don't try asking [id170] some questions about which one it is.	R					
342940	345940	Which one it is?	id169		L			
345940	346940	What does it look like?	id169		L			
		I don’t know	id170		S			
352940	354940	You keep saying I don't know.	id169		L			
355940	357940	I don't know.	id170		S			
365940	368940	How did you make Murphy?	id169		L			
368940	370940	How did you make Murphy?	id169		L			
370940	371940	It's Murphy.	R					
371940	372940	I didn't make him.	R					
372940	377940	But, OK, so do you want to just take your best guess at which one it is?	R					
381940	382940	OK.	id169		L			
382940	383940	This one?	id169		L			
383940	384940	I don't know.	id170		S			
384940	386940	Well, you can also ask questions.	R					
387940	389940	Which one it is?	id169		L			
389940	391940	I don't know.	id170		S			
391940	393940	Just take it.	R					
397940	399940	I don't know what it is.	id170		S			
401940	402940	You want to click your answer.	R					
402940	404940	You can just take your best guess.	R					
405940	406940	OK.	R					
406940	407940	We're going to switch back now.	R	5				
407940	410940	So now you're going to be the guesser and you're going to be the teller.	R					
413940	415940	So can you describe what's in the...	R					
415940	418940	Or can you explain to [id170] what's in the black box?	R					
419940	421940	It looks like...	id169		S			
423940	426940	What do you mean if they say it?	id170		L			
426940	429940	It looks like a man with some squares.	id169		S		a man with some squares	
429940	432940	A square in his teeth.	id169		S		a square in his teeth	
432940	433940	OK.	R					
433940	434940	Did you hear that?	R					
434940	435940	Yeah.	R					
435940	436940	OK.	R					
436940	439940	So based on that, then, which one do you think it is?	R					
439940	442940	You can also ask [id169] a question if you want to...	R					
442940	444940	Who had the dog...	id170		L		the dog	x
444940	445940	Who had...	id170		L

450940	451940	OK.	R					
451940	453940	Then do you want to take your best guess?	R					
453940	454940	OK.	R					
454940	456940	Then just click the screen when you think you know which one it is.	R					
458940	459940	Oh.	R	6				
459940	460940	That's OK.	R					
460940	461940	And now we're going to switch back.	R					
461940	462940	And now you're going to be the teller.	R					
462940	464940	Was that me or her?	id169		L			
464940	466940	Well, now it's your turn to guess.	R					
466940	469940	Was that me or her at all?	id169		L			
469940	474940	That was her iPad, because the guesser is the one who gets it right or wrong.	R					
474940	477940	But that's OK, because there's a lot of chances to help some of you.	R					
477940	482940	So do you want to tell [id169] what you see in the box?	R					
482940	483940	No?	R					
488940	491940	[id169], do you want to ask questions about what's in the box?	R

505940	507940	It's kind of like a shape.	id169		L			
507940	509940	I don't know what it is either.	id170		S			
509940	512940	And I just like to say to me too.	id170		S			
512940	516940	Well, is there anything that it looks like?	R					
516940	518940	Anything that could help you figure out?	R

574940	576940	Yeah, so you've got to explain it to [id170] though.	R					
576940	577940	Explain it to [id170].	R					
577940	579940	It is a tower.	id169		S
