0	6000	Remember how you guys play the game, and let me know if you want to go back to the classroom at any time, okay?	R					
6000	9000	Also, can I take off your name tags?	R					
9000	10000	Yeah.	id248					
10000	12000	Or can I just take it off?	R					
12000	15000	That's okay. We can still just take it off.	R					
15000	17000	Why do you want to take them off?	id247					
17000	21000	That's just the rules of the game room. I don't really know.	R					
21000	27000	Okay, so today, you guys excited? I'm excited.	R					
27000	30000	We're going to play a fun matching game, okay?	R					
30000	38000	But before we do that, we're going to practice touching our iPads by putting a little game of popping bubbles, okay?	R					
38000	43000	So do each of you want to press the blue button on your screen, and then pop all the bubbles?	R					
43000	47000	Yeah, it's pretty fast.	R					
47000	52000	And then keep popping.	R					
52000	54000	Awesome.	R					
54000	58000	Okay, so today we're going to help Smurphy.	R					
58000	61000	This is Smurphy. Do you guys want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
61000	62000	Hi, Smurphy.	id248					
		Hi, Smurphy.	id247					
62000	64000	Smurphy says hi back.	R					
64000	73000	So each of you on your screen in a second is going to see two pictures, and one of you will see a picture with a black box around it.	R					
73000	81000	Your job is to help Smurphy guess which picture is inside the black box.	R					
81000	95000	So, yeah, if you do see a black box on your screen, then you are the teller, and your job is to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
95000	105000	If you're holding Smurphy and you don't see a black box, your job is to help Smurphy guess which picture is in the black box.	R					
105000	112000	When you think you know which one it is, you're just going to tap that picture, okay?	R					
112000	116000	If you get it right, you'll see a smiley face.	R					
116000	123000	If you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face, but that's okay because Smurphy has a lot more chances.	R					
123000	126000	You're going to take turns guessing and telling.	R					
126000	128000	So, little quiz.	R					
128000	132000	If you see the black box, what should you do?	R					
132000	134000	Tell Smurphy what it is.	id248					
134000	141000	Exactly, and if you're holding Smurphy and you don't see the black box, what should you do?	R					
141000	143000	Tap it.	id247					
143000	145000	Yeah, tap and guess.	R					
145000	148000	Alright, it'll make more sense once we get started, okay?	R					
148000	154000	So, we can each press the blue again, and who has a black box on your screen?	R	1				
154000	155000	Not me.	id248		L			
155000	160000	Okay, so you're going to tell [id248] what's in the black box.	R
