65480	67760	So in this game, we're gonna be helping Smurphy.	R					
67760	68920	Do you wanna say, hi Smurphy?	R					
68920	70920	Hi Smurfy!	id191					
70920	74400	So yeah, your goal is to help Smurphy guess	R					
74400	77040	between two shapes that you're gonna see on your iPads.	R					
77040	80760	So on your screen, you're gonna see two pictures.	R					
80760	84160	And if you see the black box on your screen,	R					
84160	86360	you're gonna be the teller.	R					
86360	88480	So if you're the teller,	R					
89440	91280	then you are gonna tell Smurphy,	R					
91280	92840	oh, don't click the button just yet.	R					
92840	95120	Wait until I'm done saying the instructions, okay.	R

98280	101640	and you're gonna tell Smurphy what you see in the black box.	R					
101640	104160	And then if you're the one holding Smurphy,	R					
104160	105520	then you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
105520	107440	And you're gonna help Smurphy guess	R					
107440	109680	what picture is in the black box.	R					
109680	114120	So then when you think you know the right answer,	R					
114120	117800	then you're gonna click the one that you think it is.	R					
117800	119960	And if you get it right, you're gonna see a smily face.	R					
119960	121920	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
121920	123880	But that's okay, because we'll have a lot more chances	R					
123880	125440	to help Smurphy.	R					
125440	129640	So if we see the black box, what are we gonna do?	R					
136080	137440	So if we see the black box,	R					
137440	140440	we're gonna tell Smurphy what we see in it, okay.	R
