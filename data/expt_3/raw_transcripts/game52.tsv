0	2000	How we played the game.	R					
2000	4000	Um, very cool.	R					
4000	6000	Have you guys played the iPad before?	R					
6000	7000	No.	id208					
7000	9000	No? You've never used an iPad?	R					
9000	12000	Oh, okay. Well, yeah, today we're going to play a fun little matching game.	R					
12000	16000	But before we start, we're going to practice using the iPads.	R					
16000	19000	So if you want you can just press the blue button to get started.	R					
19000	24000	And then if you guys can tap the screen and pop all the bubbles, just like right on each one.	R					
24000	26000	Yep, just like that.	R					
26000	28000	Doing great.	R					
28000	30000	And then keep going until there's no more bubbles.	R					
30000	31000	No more. 	id207					
31000	32000	Yeah.	R					
32000	34000	Oh, there's some more.	R					
37000	38000	Nice.	R					
38000	40000	And now it's ready to finish.	R					
42000	45000	So maybe we try tapping a little softer and faster.	R					
45000	47000	Yep, just like that.	R					
47000	48000	A little softer.	R					
48000	50000	Yep, perfect.	R					
50000	51000	Alrighty.	R					
51000	53000	And now you see this guy.	R					
53000	54000	So this is Smurfy.	R					
54000	55000	Do you want to say hi to Smurfy?	R					
55000	56000	Hi Smurfy	id207					
56000	57000	Okay.	R					
57000	62000	So in this game, we're going to be helping Smurfy to guess between two shapes that you see on the screen.	R					
62000	65000	So you're going to see two shapes.	R					
65000	66000	They're going to look like this.	R					
66000	67000	One of the other.	R					
67000	72000	So if you see this and you have the black box on your screen, then you're going to be the teller.	R					
72000	76000	So you're going to tell Smurfy what you see inside the black box.	R					
76000	77000	Okay.	R					
77000	79000	And so that's what you're doing if you see the black box.	R					
79000	80000	You're the teller.	R					
80000	84000	And if you're the one holding Smurfy, that means you're going to be the guesser.	R					
84000	91000	So you're going to be helping Smurfy to guess which picture is inside the black box that the other person has.	R					
91000	95000	And if you get it, and when you think you know the answer, then you're just going to tap the answer you think it is.	R					
95000	96000	Okay.	R					
96000	98000	And if you get it right, you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
98000	100000	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
100000	104000	But that's totally okay because we'll have a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
104000	105000	Okay.	R					
105000	110000	So just to remember, if you see the black box, who are you?	R					
110000	113000	What do you do?	R					
		Teller	id208					
113000	114000	Yes.	R					
114000	115000	You're going to be the teller.	R					
115000	117000	So you're going to tell Smurfy what you see inside the black box.	R					
117000	121000	And then if you're the one holding Smurfy, what are you going to do?	R					
121000	122000	Guess.	id208					
122000	123000	Yeah.	R					
123000	124000	You're going to be the guesser.	R					
124000	125000	Okay.	R					
125000	126000	I think you guys are ready to play.	R					
126000	127000	Okay.	R					
127000	128000	Do you understand?	R					
128000	129000	All right.	R					
129000	130000	Perfect.	R					
130000	131000	Okay.	R					
131000	136000	So if you want to click the blue button to get started.	R					
136000	137000	All right.	R	1				
137000	138000	So who has the black box?	R					
138000	139000	Me?	id208		S			
139000	140000	Okay.	R					
140000	142000	So that means you're going to start and be the teller and you're going to be the guesser.	R					
142000	143000	So you get Smurfy.	R					
143000	146000	There you go.	R					
146000	149000	So [id208], could you tell [id207] what you see inside the black box?	R					
149000	150000	an apple	id208		S		an apple	Y
150000	151000	Okay.	R					
151000	155000	And then [id207], when you have a guess, then just click the screen.	R					
155000	157000	Which one do you think it is?	R					
157000	158000	Nice.	R					
158000	159000	Just like that.	R					
159000	160000	And now we're going to switch.	R	2				
160000	163000	So now you have the black box, which means you're going to be the teller and you're going	R					
163000	164000	to be the guesser.	R					
164000	165000	Okay.	R					
165000	171000	So [id207], could you tell [id208] what you see inside the box?	R

172000	173000	Perfect.	R					
173000	174000	Just like that.	R					
174000	179000	And then, so when you have a guess, then you can just tap the screen.	R					
179000	181000	Which one do you think it is?	R					
181000	182000	Yeah.	R					
183000	184000	Perfect.	R					
184000	185000	Now we're going to switch back.	R	3				
185000	189000	And so now you're going to be the guesser and you're going to be the teller.	R					
189000	194000	I don't know what this is though.	id208		S			Y
194000	195000	That's okay.	R					
195000	199000	Can you describe it to [id207]?	R

203000	207000	Yeah, it was perfect.	R					
207000	208000	And, oh, okay.	R	4				
208000	210000	It was the other one, but that's okay.	R					
210000	212000	We'll have a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
212000	213000	All right.	R					
213000	214000	And now we're going to switch back.	R					
214000	224000	And now you're going to be the guesser and you're going to be the teller.	R
