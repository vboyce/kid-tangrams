47000	50000	Okay, so you guys can start by clicking the blue buttons.	R					
50000	51000	You guys started.	R					
51000	55000	And then, now, if you just touch the iPads and pop all the bubbles.	R					
55000	58000	Awesome. Yeah, just like that.	R					
59000	60000	Done.	id200

74000	75000	Hi, Smurfy.	id199					
75000	81000	So, today, you're gonna be helping Smurfy to try to guess between two shapes that you see on your screen.	R					
81000	85000	So, if you see a black box around your shape,	R					
85000	87000	then you're gonna help Smurfy.	R					
87000	89000	You're gonna tell Smurfy what you see inside the box.	R					
89000	90000	Okay.	id200					
90000	92000	Yeah, so you're gonna be the teller, just like that.	R					
92000	95000	So, if you see the black box, you're gonna be the teller.	R					
95000	98000	And if you're the one holding Smurfy, you're gonna be the guesser.	R					
98000	103000	So, you're gonna listen to the teller and try to guess which one of them that they're talking about.	R					
103000	107000	And when you think you know the right answer, then you're just gonna tap it on your screen, just like that.	R					
107000	108000	Okay.	id200					
108000	109000	Okay, so, just to...	R					
109000	112000	Oh, and if you get it right, then you'll see a smiley face.	R					
112000	114000	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
114000	117000	But that's okay, because there's a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
117000	118000	So, yeah.	R					
118000	121000	If you see the black box, what are you gonna do?	R
