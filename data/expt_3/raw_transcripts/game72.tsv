0	5000	We're going to practice touching our iPads by playing a little game of popping bubbles.	R					
5000	6000	Okay?	R					
6000	10720	So can each of you press the blue button on your screen?	R					
10720	14000	And now can you pop all the bubbles?	R					
14000	20240	Yeah, great job.	R					
20240	22360	And now there are more bubbles.	R					
		what?	id229					
22360	25200	I know, even more of them.	R					
25200	27520	Wow, great job, [id230]le.	R					
28520	34520	All right, so now I'm going to explain the matching game.	R					
34520	36520	So today we're going to help Smurphy.	R					
36520	37520	This is Smurphy.	R					
37520	39520	You guys want to say hi to Smurphy?	R					
39520	40520	Hi.	id229					
40520	43520	Smurphy says hi back.	R					
43520	47520	So each of you on your screen are going to see two pictures.	R					
47520	52520	And one of you will see a picture surrounded by a black box.	R					
52520	59520	And Smurphy's job is to guess which picture is inside the black box.	R					
59520	66520	So one of you, if you see the black box on the screen, your job is the teller.	R					
66520	71520	You have to tell Smurphy using your words what's in the black box.	R					
71520	77520	If you don't have a black box on your screen, if you don't see one and you're holding Smurphy,	R					
77520	79520	then you're the guesser.	R					
79520	85520	And your job is to help Smurphy guess which picture is in the black box, all right?	R					
85520	91520	And when you feel pretty sure you know which picture that is, you're going to touch that picture.	R					
91520	94520	If you get it right, you'll get a smiley face.	R					
94520	97520	If not, you'll get a frowny face.	R					
97520	102520	But that's okay because Smurphy has a lot more chances to get it right.	R					
102520	105520	So I'm going to give you a little quiz.	R					
105520	108520	If you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
108520	110520	Tell Smurphy.	id229					
110520	114520	You tell Smurphy what's in the black box.	R					
114520	118520	And if you don't see the black box, what do you do?	R					
118520	120520	You'll be the guesser.	id229					
120520	125520	Yeah, you're going to help Smurphy guess which picture is in the black box.	R					
125520	127520	Does this make sense, [id230]?	R					
127520	131520	Yeah? So you guys have to help each other out. You think you can do that?	R					
131520	138520	Okay. Why don't each of you touch the blue pictures, the blue button?	R	1				
138520	143520	I don't touch it. What are you talking about?	id229		L			
143520	145520	You want to touch it? All right.	R					
145520	148520	So which of you sees the black box?	R					
148520	149520	Not me.	id229		L			
149520	156520	Okay. So you're going to tell him what's in the black box and he has to guess.	R
