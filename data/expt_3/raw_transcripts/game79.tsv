35640	39280	So today, we get to play a fun matching game.	R					
39280	40880	But before we do that, we're going	R					
40880	43520	to play a little game of popping bubbles, just	R					
43520	46280	to practice touching our iPads, OK?	R					
46280	49960	So can you all press the blue buttons on your screen?	R					
49960	51840	And then I want you to pop all the bubbles.	R					
54520	55480	The blue ones?	id243					
55480	57640	All of them, yeah.	R					
57640	60680	And then get the red and the orange.	R					
60680	63480	And then keep popping.	R					
63480	64600	Get all the bubbles, yeah.	R					
67880	68920	Great [id243].	R					
68920	70480	We're just going to wait for [id244] now.	R					
73160	74480	Awesome.	R					
74480	77000	So now I'm going to explain the matching game.	R					
77000	79600	So today, we're going to help Smurphy.	R					
79600	80560	This is Smurphy.	R					
80560	81680	Do you guys want to say hi?	R					
81680	82560	Yeah.	id243					
82560	83400	Hi, Smurphy.	id243					
83400	85640	Smurphy says hi back.	R					
85640	90080	So each of you on your screens is going to see two pictures.	R					
90080	92600	And one of the pictures, one of you	R					
92600	96520	will see a picture surrounded by a black box.	R					
96520	100520	And if you see the black box, you are the teller.	R					
100520	104680	And your job is to tell Smurphy which picture is	R					
104680	106440	in the black box.	R					
106440	110960	If you are holding Smurphy, then you are the guesser.	R					
110960	113800	And your job is to help Smurphy guess	R					
113800	117000	which picture is in the black box.	R					
117000	119680	When you think you know which picture it is,	R					
119680	123560	you're just going to touch that picture, OK?	R					
123560	126800	If you get it right, you'll see a smiley face.	R					
126800	130200	If you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
130200	135040	But that's OK because Smurphy has a lot more chances.	R					
135040	138160	You're going to take turns guessing and telling.	R					
138160	143640	So if you see the black box on your screen, what do you do?	R					
144680	145920	Point to it.	id244					
145920	149120	You're going to tell Smurphy with your words	R					
149120	151680	which picture is in the black box.	R					
151680	156480	And if you're holding Smurphy, and you see that, something	R					
156480	159760	like that, with no black box, what do you do?	R					
159760	162080	Don't touch it.	id244					
162080	165080	Yeah, you're going to touch whichever picture you think	R					
165080	166800	is in the black box.	R					
166800	168840	I definitely know.	id244					
168840	170680	So we're going to try one more time.	R					
170680	171840	I'll know, I'll definitely know.	id244					
171840	175520	If you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
175520	176560	You're going to tell.	R					
176560	179280	It'll make more sense once we start, OK?	R					
179280	185040	So I want each of you to press the blue buttons.	R					
185040	188360	Now, which of you sees the black box?	R	1				
188360	188720	You.	R					
188720	192120	So you're going to be telling, and you're going to be guessing.	R					
192120	196720	It's a banana.	id244		S		banana	Y
196720	201520	And yeah, press it when you think you know which one it is.	R
