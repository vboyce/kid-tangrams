		what’s a matching game? What’s a matching game?	id283					
9640	11640	I'll explain it in a second	R					
		I have played a matching game, so I already know	id284					
		I have played a matching game	id283					
		I have already played a matching game a long time ago	id284					
22640	28000	It might be a different matching thing game than you guys are used to but first I'm gonna have you guys practice	R					
28520	34120	Touching the iPads by popping some bubbles. So go ahead and press the blue button to start 	R					
		like this one?	id284					
34120	39020	Yeah, that one right there, and then just keep popping the bubbles until there's no bubbles left	R					
		Yay, go done.	id283					
46360	50360	It looks like there's still some bubbles on yours so keep popping them	R					
		That was fun	id283					
		That was fun	R					
58720	64920	Amazing all right now. I'll explain our matching game. So today we're gonna help Smurfy. This is Smurfy	R					
		Do you want to say hi?	R					
		Hi Smurfy	id283					
68120	70120	All right, so Smurfy needs your help	R					
70680	74800	So on each of your iPads you guys are gonna see two pictures	R					
75000	82040	My sister has a real iPad.	id284					
		 A real iPad? Now you guys are gonna see. 	R					
82040	85200	My sister is nine years old So she has a real iPad. 	id284					
		Oh cool	R					
85200	89840	We can talk about your sister after but for this game you guys are both gonna see two pictures	R					
90160	94080	But one of you is gonna see a black box around one of the pictures like this	R					
94920	99320	Smurfy's job is to guess which picture is inside the black box and	R					
99920	101920	You guys are gonna help him	R					
102160	108000	So if you see the black box, you're the teller and you're gonna tell Smurfy. What's in the black box?	R					
108040	110040	So what do you guys see?	R					
		Banana	id284					
110680	112680	A banana? Exactly	R					
		This is going to be easy	id283					
113680	117720	Oh, yeah, and if you don't see a black box like this	R					
117720	121960	You're gonna hold Smurfy and then you're gonna try to guess what's in the black box	R					
122520	126680	Now when you think you have your guess you can tap on it like this on the iPads	R					
127480	131920	Does that make sense? Now you guys are gonna take turns guessing and telling and	R					
132360	135720	If you get the guess right, you're gonna see a smiley face	R					
135720	138160	But if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face	R					
138320	143280	But that's okay because we're gonna have a lot of different turns to help Smurfy out	R					
		Okay.	id283					
144440	147520	Okay, so if you see the black box, what are you gonna do?	R					
		Umm, push the button?	id284

156320	159800	if you don't see the box then you're gonna press the button and	R					
161040	165160	Try to guess what the other person sees in the box. Does that make sense?	R
