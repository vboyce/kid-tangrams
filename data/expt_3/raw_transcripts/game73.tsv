0	6000	Alright, and then let me know if you want to go back to the classroom at any point, okay?	R					
6000	9000	Okay, why is the camera not flashing?	id231					
9000	12000	It is flashing, it's just flashing in the back.	R					
12000	17000	Okay, so today we're going to play a fun matching game, but before we do that,	R					
17000	22000	we're going to practice touching our iPads by playing a game of popping bubbles.	R					
22000	24000	Why? Is there a stuffy?	id231					
24000	29000	I'll explain in one moment. You want to press the blue button on your screen?	R					
29000	32000	And I want you to pop all the bubbles.	R					
34000	37000	Yeah, great job.	R					
37000	40000	And then you want to pop the rest of the bubbles.	R					
45000	50000	Yeah, if you just tap quickly, yeah.	R					
50000	53000	You can just go like this, like this, yeah.	R					
55000	57000	Look!	id232					
57000	61000	Oh, you finished. Now we just have to wait for [id231], and he's almost...	R					
61000	63000	And [id231] finished, too. Awesome.	R					
63000	67000	Okay, so now I'm going to explain the matching game, okay?	R					
67000	71000	So today we're going to help out Smurphy.	R					
71000	73000	This is Smurphy, do you guys want to say hi?	R					
		hi	id231					
73000	75000	Smurphy says hi back.	R					
75000	79000	So each of you on your screen is going to see two pictures,	R					
79000	83000	and one of you will see a picture surrounded by a black box.	R					
83000	88000	And Smurphy's job is to guess which picture is inside the black box,	R					
88000	90000	and you guys get to help him, okay?	R					
90000	93000	So one of you on your screen will see the black box,	R					
93000	100000	and that person's job is to tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
100000	102000	So you'll use your word to tell Smurphy.	R					
102000	106000	The other person will not see a black box,	R					
106000	111000	and their job is to help Smurphy guess which picture is in the black box.	R					
111000	114000	And when you feel pretty sure you know which picture it is,	R					
114000	116000	you're just going to touch that picture.	R					
116000	119000	If you get it right, you'll see a smiley face.	R					
119000	121000	If not, you'll see a frowny face,	R					
121000	124000	but that's okay because Smurphy has more chances.	R					
124000	128000	So you're going to take turns guessing and telling.	R					
128000	132000	If you see the black box, what do you do?	R					
132000	135000	Tell Smurphy.	id231					
135000	137000	You tell Smurphy, that's exactly right.	R					
137000	140000	You'll tell Smurphy what's in the black box.	R					
140000	146000	If you don't see the black box and you're holding Smurphy, what should you do?	R					
146000	149000	You touch it, yeah, you're going to help Smurphy guess.	R					
149000	153000	All right, we're ready to begin.	R					
153000	157000	Do you guys want to touch the blue button?	R					
157000	159000	Okay, which of you sees the black box?	R	1
