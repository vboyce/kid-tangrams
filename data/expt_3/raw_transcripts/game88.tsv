5520	11480	All right, so today we're gonna play a very fun matching game and it's gonna be played on these iPads	R					
11960	16160	So first before I explain the game, I'm gonna have you pop some bubbles	R					
16680	20800	So go ahead and touch the touch the blue button to get started and	R					
21640	25100	Then pop the bubbles with your fingers until there's no more bubbles	R					
		Pop. Pop. 	id258					
		I popped all of them. 	id257					
30640	32640	You popped all of them	R					
		I popped all of them. 	id258					
32920	36800	Are you sure are there's still more bubbles? I see some more bubbles on your screen	R					
		Pop?	id258					
		Yep, keep popping.	R					
38640	41600	Yeah, it looks like [id257]’s done. 	R					
		Can I pop it?	id258					
		Yes, you can	R					
49120	55220	All right, nice job popping the bubbles guys I'm gonna take this back and now I'm gonna explain the matching game	R					
55860	61140	All right, so in this game, we're gonna help our friend Smurfy. This is Smurfy. Do you guys want to say hi to him?	R					
62340	63860	Hi	id258					
		Hi	id257					
		Hi	R					
63860	70260	All right, so Smurfy needs your help so on your screens. You guys are going to see two pictures like this	R					
71100	74740	But one of you guys is going to see one of the pictures in a black box	R					
75060	77500	So see how this picture is inside of a black box	R					
78300	83460	So your your job is to help Smurfy guess which picture is inside the black box	R					
84100	90740	So if you see a black box on your screen, that means you're the teller and you're gonna help tell Smurfy	R					
90740	92820	What's in the black box?	R					
92820	96820	Now if you're holding Smurfy and you don't see a black box like this	R					
96820	99860	You're gonna be the guesser and your job is to help guess	R					
101060	103060	What what pictures in the black box?	R					
		I saw the banana.	id257					
104260	106820	Yeah, you saw that there was a banana in the black box	R					
106820	113220	Yeah, so the teller would tell Smurfy and the guesser that they see a banana in the black box	R					
113860	115860	and then when the	R					
116660	121540	When the guesser thinks they know what's in the black box, they'll press it like this on the iPad	R					
122900	127220	Now if you guess the correct picture, you're gonna see a smiley face up here on the screen	R					
127700	132180	But if you don't see it, um, if you don't guess the right picture, you're gonna see a frowny face	R					
133620	135060	Okay	R					
135060	137460	You need to you need to do like this	id258					
137940	140660	You don't need to put your whole finger on the tablets	id258					
141140	145780	Yes, you're going to just like how you pop the bubbles. You're gonna press your finger on the tablets	R					
146980	149700	And if you don't get it, right, you're gonna see a frowny face	R					
149860	153620	But that's okay because we're gonna have lots of different times to help Smurfy out	R					
154100	160420	We're also gonna take turns, um guessing and telling. So if you see the black box, what are you gonna do?	R

167380	170180	You're gonna say you're gonna tell him what's inside the black box	R					
170660	173940	But if you see no black box, what are you gonna do?	R
