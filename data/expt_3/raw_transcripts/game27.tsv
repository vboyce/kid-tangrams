0	4000	Alrighty, now it's recording.	R					
4000	12000	Okay, so today we're going to play a fun little matching game, but before we do that we're going to practice using the iPads.	R					
12000	15000	So if you can click the button on the blue button on your screens.	R					
15000	18000	Yeah, and now touch all the bubbles to make them pop.	R					
18000	21000	Yeah, just like that.	R					
24000	28000	And just keep popping the bubbles until there's no more of them.	R					
31000	34000	Nice. Good job.	R					
34000	38000	Okay, and so now I'm going to explain the rules of my game.	R					
38000	41000	So in this game we're going to be helping Smurfy.	R					
41000	44000	This is Smurfy. Do you want to say hi?	R					
44000	50000	So Smurfy is trying to guess between two shapes that you're going to see on your iPads.	R					
50000	55000	So on your iPads you're going to see two shapes like this.	R					
55000	62000	And if you see a black box around one of the shapes, then you are going to be the teller.	R					
62000	65000	And you're going to tell Smurfy, oh don't click anything out yet.	R					
65000	71000	And if you're the teller, you're going to try to tell Smurfy what you see in the black box.	R					
71000	76000	So if you saw this, then you'd be telling Smurfy that you see a banana, right?	R					
76000	81000	Okay, and then the other person is going to be holding Smurfy.	R					
81000	84000	And if you're holding Smurfy, you're not going to have a black box.	R					
84000	90000	And your job is to help Smurfy to guess which one it is from the teller.	R					
90000	95000	So the teller will tell you which one that you're supposed to click.	R					
95000	99000	And then if you're the guesser and you get it right, then you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
99000	101000	And if you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
101000	105000	But that's totally okay because there's going to be a lot of chances to help Smurfy.	R					
105000	112000	Okay, so if you see the black box, what are you going to do?	R					
113000	115000	Tell Smurfy it's a banana.	id173					
115000	118000	Yeah, well tell Smurfy whatever's in the black box.	R					
118000	121000	And then if you're the one holding Smurfy, what are you going to do?	R					
121000	123000	You're not going to tell.	id173					
123000	124000	Yeah, you're going to guess.	R					
124000	127000	So you're going to help Smurfy to guess.	R					
127000	130000	And okay, I think you guys are ready to play.	R					
130000	132000	I'm going to tell.	id173					
133000	135000	Yeah, it's going to switch back and forth.	R					
135000	138000	So each round after you're the teller, then you're going to be the guesser, then you're going to be the teller again.	R					
138000	140000	So it goes back and forth.	R					
140000	142000	So you guys can click the blue button to start.	R					
142000	144000	And...	R					
144000	146000	Okay, so who has the black box?	R	1				
146000	148000	You have it?	R					
148000	150000	Okay, so then you are going to be the guesser first.	R					
150000	156000	So can you tell [id173] what you see in the black box?	R					
156000	158000	Banana?	id174		S		banana	Y
158000	159000	Okay.	R					
159000	164000	And then [id173], once you have your best guess at which one it is, then you can just click it on the screen.	R					
165000	166000	Nice.	R					
166000	167000	Okay, good job.	R					
167000	168000	And now we're going to switch.	R					
168000	170000	And now you have the black box.	R	2				
170000	172000	And now you're going to be the guesser.	R

179000	180000	So now you're guessing.	R					
180000	183000	So now just tap the iPad, which one do you think it is?	R					
188000	189000	Nice.	R	3				
189000	190000	And now we go back.	R
