10000	15060	 today, we're gonna play a very fun matching game	R					
15060	22520	Okay, and it's gonna be played on these iPads, but first I'm gonna have you guys pop some bubbles to help touch the iPads	R

57740	61180	So today we're gonna help Smurphy play this matching game	R					
61500	65940	So on your screens, you guys are both gonna see two pictures something like this	R					
66540	70300	Now one of you is gonna see a black box around one of the pictures	R					
70540	73260	So you see how this picture has a black box around it?	R					
76300	82740	So Smurphy's job is to guess which picture is inside the black box and you guys are gonna help it	R

102660	106140	Now if you guess correctly, then you're gonna see a smiley face	R					
106260	109100	But if you guess incorrectly, you're gonna see a frowny face	R					
109220	113140	But that's okay because we're gonna have lots of different tries to help Smurphy out	R					
113860	116900	Now we're gonna take turns being the teller and the guesser	R
