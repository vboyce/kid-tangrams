0	4720	So I remember how you all play the game, and then can I take off your name tags?	R					
5720	6720	Yeah.	id252					
		Why? Why do we take them off?	id252					
8220	14760	That's just the rules of the game room, and let me know if you want to go back to the classroom at any point.	R					
		Close the door?	id252					
16200	18200	You have to leave it a little bit open,	R					
19040	23640	unfortunately, just so like teachers can walk in and I know that you you all are in here.	R					
24880	26100	Okay	id252					
26100	32060	So today we're gonna play a fun matching game, which yay. But before we do that	R					
32220	38100	we're gonna practice touching our iPads by playing a little game of popping bubbles, okay?	R					
38420	44820	So you all want to press the blue buttons on your screen and then pop all the bubbles. Yeah, that went right there.	R					
46060	50080	Yeah, she's doing the same thing. Just touch it and then pop all the bubbles.	R					
51500	53500	Yeah.	R					
57100	60500	Awesome, and then pop all the new bubbles. We'll just wait for her to finish.	R					
63660	70340	Great job. So, um, this is Smurphy. Today we're gonna help Smurphy. Do you guys want to say hi?	R					
		hi	id251					
		hi	id252					
71580	73580	Smurphy says hi back, okay?	R					
74380	75780	So today	R					
75780	83660	we're gonna play a fun matching game. Each of you on your screen is gonna see two shapes, and one of you will see a shape	R					
84020	86020	surrounded by a black box.	R					
86820	93140	If you see the black box, you are the teller, and your job is to tell Smurphy	R					
93420	97060	which picture is inside the black box.	R					
97820	102900	If you don't see a black box on your screen and you're holding Smurphy,	R					
103140	111260	then you are the guesser, and your job is to guess which picture is inside the black box.	R					
111980	113820	Okay?	R					
113820	119820	When you think you know which picture it is, you're just going to touch that picture like so.	R					
120540	127020	If you get it right, you'll see a smiley face. If you get it wrong, you'll see a frowny face.	R					
127260	131780	But that's okay because Smurphy has a lot more chances to guess and tell.	R					
132460	139820	You'll take turns guessing and telling. So like a little quiz, if you see a black box on your screen,	R					
140300	142300	what should you do?	R					
144940	148660	You should tell Smurphy which picture is in the black box.	R					
149740	152020	So if you see a black box, what should you do?	R					
153020	154780	Tell Smurphy.	id251					
154780	161180	Exactly. If you don't see a black box and you're holding Smurphy, what should you do?	R					
161180	161980	Guess.	id252					
161980	163980	And how do you guess?	R					
164940	168940	By guessing which one is in the box.	id251					
168940	170940	And touching it. Exactly.	R					
170940	173420	I know this one is in the black box.	id251					
174380	178780	There you go. All right, I think we're ready to begin and the game will make more sense.	R					
179180	183900	So touch the blue boxes. Now who has the black box on their screen?	R					
185020	187980	So you'll be telling and you'll be helping Smurphy guess.	R	1				
191100	193100	So what do you see, [id252]?	R					
194940	196940	an	id252		S

198940	200940	Apple.	id252		S		apple	
200940	202940	And do you want to guess now?	R					
204220	206220	How do you guess?	R					
207260	209660	By tapping. Do you want to tap which one you think it is?	R					
212060	214940	Tap, whichever one she just said was in the black box.	R					
216860	218060	Awesome.	R	2				
218060	221900	Now we'll pass Smurphy and you're going to be the one telling.	R
