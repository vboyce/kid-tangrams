0	3280	Alrighty, there it is.	R					
3280	9440	Okay, so today we're going to play a fun ball matching game, but before we do that we're	R					
9440	14280	going to get used to using the iPads, and so if you click the blue buttons, then we're	R					
14280	19720	going to see some bubbles on the screen, and if you can click all the bubbles to pop them.	R					
19720	20720	Nice.	R					
20720	21720	Yep.	R					
22440	30720	And then keep going until you see no bubbles, and there's going to be like a blue swan.	R					
30720	32720	Oh, there it is.	R					
32720	33720	Awesome.	R					
33720	36960	Okay, so now I'm going to explain the rules of the game.	R					
36960	38960	So this is Murphy.	R					
38960	40960	Do you want to say hi to Murphy?	R					
40960	41960	Hi Murphy.	id167					
41960	42960	Hi.	id168					
42960	48840	The goal of this game is to try to help Murphy to guess some pictures.	R					
48840	52280	So on your screen, you're going to see two pictures.	R					
52280	56400	One of them will have a black box around them, and your goal is to help Murphy to guess which	R					
56400	58520	one has the black box around it.	R					
58520	60520	So this one would be the banana.	R					
60520	62520	Wait, don't like that one yet.	R					
62520	64840	Wait until I'm not explaining the rules.	R					
64840	66840	So leave the blue button on.	R					
66840	69840	I knew you would say that.	id168					
69840	71840	We can do it again.	id167					
71840	72840	What?	R					
72840	74520	Well, I'm explaining the new game now.	R					
74520	76960	The bubbles were just to get used to using the iPads.	R					
76960	82080	So in this game, you're going to see the two pictures, and when you see the black box,	R					
82080	86320	then you're going to be the teller, and you're going to try to tell Murphy what you see in	R					
86320	87880	the black box.	R					
87880	91360	And then if you're the one holding Murphy, then you're going to be the guesser, and you're	R					
91360	93400	going to see this, and there's no black box.	R					
93400	97600	And your goal is to try to help Murphy guess which one the other person sees that has a	R					
97600	99760	black box around it.	R					
99760	102720	And so if you guess right, then you're going to see a smiley face.	R					
102720	105120	And if you guess it wrong, you're going to see a frowny face.	R					
105120	108720	But that's okay because we're going to have more chances to help Murphy.	R					
108720	109720	Yeah.	R					
109720	110720	Okay.	R					
110720	115720	So if you see a black box around the picture, what are you going to do?	R					
115720	120120	We're going to tell Murphy what's in it.	id168					
120120	121120	Yeah.	R					
121120	123200	So you're going to try to tell Murphy what's going on.	R					
123200	126120	And if you're holding Murphy, what are you going to do?	R					
126120	131120	Try to figure out which has the black box in it.	id168					
131120	132120	Yeah, that's right.	R					
132120	133120	You're going to be the guesser.	R					
133120	134920	So you're going to listen to the teller and try to guess.	R					
134920	135920	Okay.	R					
135920	136920	I think yours are ready.	R					
136920	137920	Okay.	R					
137920	141920	So if you click the blue buttons and you can start, and don't click anything yet.	R					
141920	142920	Okay.	R					
142920	144920	So which one of you has the black box?	R	1				
144920	145920	The apple.	id167	 	S		the apple	
145920	146920	Okay.	R					
146920	148920	So you have the black box?	R					
148920	149920	Okay.	R					
149920	150920	Yeah.	R					
150920	151920	So you have the black box.	R					
151920	153920	So we're not going to turn our iPads in this game.	R					
153920	154920	We're going to use our words.	R					
154920	156920	So then that means that you are the guesser.	R					
156920	157920	So you get Murphy.	R					
157920	162920	And so can you tell [id168] what is on the screen?	R					
163920	167920	There's an apple, but the banana was not a square.	id167		S			
167920	168920	Okay.	R					
168920	170920	So you explain the one that has the box.	R					
170920	173920	The box is on the banana.	id167		S			
173920	174920	Here.	R					
174920	175920	Yeah.	R					
175920	177920	But on your screen, which one has the box around it?	R					
177920	178920	The apple.	id167		S			
178920	179920	Okay.	R					
179920	181920	So then you're going to help Murphy guess.	R					
181920	188920	So you're going to touch the iPad, whichever one follows what she said.	R					
188920	190920	Push the apple.	id168		L			x
190920	191920	Okay.	R					
191920	192920	So click it.	R					
192920	193920	Click a little harder.	R					
197920	198920	Do I click?	id168		L			
198920	199920	Try again.	R					
202920	203920	Okay.	R					
203920	204920	Let me try.	R					
204920	205920	Okay.	R					
205920	207920	So you just click a little longer and harder on it.	R					
207920	208920	Okay.	R					
208920	209920	And now we're going to switch.	R	2				
209920	212920	So now you are going to be the guesser and you're going to be the teller.	R					
212920	215920	So can you explain what you see in the black box?	R					
215920	220920	The bird is in the box, but the dog is not.	id168		S		the bird	
220920	221920	Okay.	R					
221920	223920	So you only have to explain the one in the black box.	R					
223920	224920	Okay.	R					
224920	225920	Oh.	R					
225920	226920	And then so you're going to guess.	R					
226920	229920	So you're going to click what you think it is that he was explaining.	R					
233920	234920	Okay.	R					
234920	237920	So it wasn't right, but we're going to have more chances.	R	3				
237920	242920	So now we're going to switch and now explain what you see in the black box.	R					
242920	245920	It's a Mr. Sun in the box.	id167		S		a mister sun	
251920	253920	It's the Sun in the box.	id168		L		the sun	x
