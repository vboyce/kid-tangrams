    Communication is important and stuff and kids need to learn it to. One task that illustrates the rich communicative capabilities is iterated reference games, where adults jointly converge on mutually understandable names for novel objects. Some prominent early experiments where children did not succeed led to the belief that children could not do this task. TODO FIX. However, more recent work with lessened task demands suggests that children may be more capable than previously thought. Here, we test children's communicative adaption to a partner with iterated reference games played by pairs of 4-5 year old preschoolers. Across a total of N pairs of children, we find children can accurately pick out referents for each other and that they are sensitive to the descriptions of their partners. TODO wrap up sentence.

# TODOs

* Include fun examples of the things kiddos said

* fix transcripts to have kid ids that are more consistent (not pear123)

* are there analyses to link success with description sticking (do successful descriptions stick more) 

* qual description of different ways kids do coordinate with each other

* do we want to meta-analyze at all

* Experiment 1: do children match the descriptions their partner uses 

* Experiment 1 + experiment 2: We will also analyze the transcripts to look at childrenâ€™s turn-taking structure and how they understand each other. 

# Introduction

TODO introduction

# Experiment 1 Methods

Our goal for experiment 1 was to test young children's ability to coordinate on descriptions to abstract shapes that their partner could understand. Young children can be very sensitive to task demands and cognitive load that can hide early abilities (TODO cite something for this), so we wanted to use a simple paradigm with experimenter scaffolding. We adapted the experimental framework from @leung, but further simplified it by reducing the total pool of targets and the number of trials children completed. 

This experiment was pre-registered at https://osf.io/kcv8j. 

## Participants
4 and 5 year old children were recruited from a university nursery school during the school day. Children played with another child from the same class. TODO any exclusions Experiment 1 was conducted between June and August 2023. Children were only included in analysis if they completed at least 8 of the critical trials. We had XX complete games and YY incomplete, but included games. TODO children's age range + median and gender split. 

## Materials
For the target stimuli, we used four of the ten tangram images from @leung, chosen based on visual dissimilarity. The matching game was coded as an Empirica experiment (CITATION) and run on two tablets locked in a kiosk mode so children could access other websites or apps. 

## Procedure
Once a pair of children agreed to play the game, they were taken to a quiet testing room where procedure was explained to them. Children were introduced to a stuffed animal "Smurfy" who wanted to play a matching game. Children sat across a table from each other, each with a tablet in front of them. On each trial, one child saw two images, one of them in a black box, and was asked to "say what they saw" in the black box so their partner (and Smurfy) could tap the corresponding image. The guesser saw the same two images (in a randomized order), but with neither boxed. Upon tapping an image, both children recieved feedback in form of a smiley or frowney face and an audible sound. After each trial, children's roled switched, demarcated by passing Smurfy back and forth. 

Children completed two warm-up trials with black and white images of familiar shapes, followed by 3 blocks of the 4 targets. Targets were randomly paired with another of the critical images as the foil. 

The experimenters running the game did not volunteer descriptions, but did scaffold the interaction, prompting children to describe the images, and sometimes repeating children's statements. The entire interaction was video-recorded.

```

## Data processing

Children's selections and the time to selection were recorded from the experiment software. Children's descriptions were transcribed from the video-recording, using Whisper (CITE) for the first pass and then hand-corrected by experimenters. Transcripts were hand-annotated for when each trial started, who said each line, and what referential descriptions were used. 

We excluded trials where the child in the teller role did not produce a description, or where all description was unintelligible and impossible to transcribe. 

## Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were run in brms with weakly informative priors. We present the estimate and 95% credible intervals.

                                  trial.num=trial-2) |> filter(type!="practice")
acc_mod_1 <- brm(correct.num ~ trial.num + (trial.num|game) + (1|target),
               family = bernoulli(link = "logit"),
               data=acc_mod_data_1,

acc_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form,"acc_1.rds"))
```

We fit a mixed effects model of accuracy (`r acc_form |> form()`). Children's accuracy was above chance (Odds Ratio: `r stats_text(acc_mod_1,1)`) and accuracy slightly increased over the game (OR of one trial later: `r stats_text(acc_mod_1, 2)`). 

## Speed

```{r, eval=F}

speed_priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(60,100)", class="Intercept"),
set_prior("normal(0,20)", class="b"),
set_prior("normal(0,20)", class="sd"),
set_prior("lkj(1)", class="cor")
)

speed_mod_data_1 <- clean_1 |> mutate(time.sec=time/1000,
                                  trial.num=trial-2) |> filter(type!="practice")

speed_mod_1 <- brm(time.sec ~ trial.num + (trial.num|game) + (1|target),
               data=speed_mod_data_1,
               file = here(mod_loc, "speed_1.rds"),
               prior=speed_priors,
               control = list(adapt_delta=.95))
```

```{r}
speed_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "speed_1.rds"))

speed_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "speed_1.rds"))
```

We ran a Bayesian mixed effects model of how long each trial took over time: `r speed_form |> form()`. The first trial was `r stats_text(speed_mod_1, 1)`, and children got faster over time (`r stats_text(speed_mod_1, 2)`). 

## Description length


```{r, eval=F}

description_priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(5,10)", class="Intercept"),
set_prior("normal(0,5)", class="b"),
set_prior("normal(0,5)", class="sd"),
set_prior("lkj(1)", class="cor")
)

description_mod_data_1 <- clean_1 |> mutate(
                                  trial.num=trial-2) |> filter(type!="practice")

description_mod_1 <- brm(words ~ trial.num + (trial.num|game) + (1|target),
               data=description_mod_data_1,
               file = here(mod_loc, "description_1.rds"),
               prior=speed_priors,
               control = list(adapt_delta=.95))

```

```{r description, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "TODO \\label{accuracy}" }
    

clean_2 |>
    filter(type!="practice") |> mutate(trial=trial-3, expt="Expt 2") |> 
  bind_rows(clean_1 |> filter(type!="practice") |> mutate(trial=trial-1, expt="Expt 1")) |> ggplot( aes(x = trial, y = words, color = type)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .5, color = "grey") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 20, 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = time_palette) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +

  facet_grid(expt~.)+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank())
```




```{r}
description_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_1.rds"))

description_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "description_1.rds"))

```

We ran a Bayesian mixed effects model of how long of a description the "teller" produced: `r description_form |> form()`. The initial length was `r stats_text(description_mod_1, 1)` and description length was relatively stable over time (`r stats_text(description_mod_1, 2)`).

There were too few trials to really look at change over time in this short experiment. However, we were able to look at ... 

We tried various ways of looking at the semantic similarities of descriptions children produced. TODO talk about SBERT

# Experiment 1 Discussion

# Experiment 2 Methods

After the first experiment, we wanted to run another study using the same paradigm, but fixing issues that arose during experiment 1. We also tightened the experimenter script to reduce the possibility that the experimenters were influencing children's descriptions and understanding of descriptions. Given that most pairs in experiment 1 were able to play the game fairly quickly, we also added a 4th experimental block to be able to look for change over time. 

As Experiment 2 was very similar to Experiment 1, here we note the differences. Experiment 2 was pre-registered at https://osf.io/y2dax. 

## Participants
Experiment 2 was run between March and August of 2024, at the same university preschool. No children participated in both experiments. ZZ pairs of children completed all 16 critical trials, and YY pairs of children completed between 8 and 16 critical trials. TODO mention that one kid was actually too young TODO mention age range / median and gender distribution. 

## Materials
The same 4 critical images were used as in experiment 1, although this time, children saw these images 4 times. In response to some children struggling with the abrupt switch from nameable to non-nameable shapes, we introduced more practice trials for experiment 2. Additionally, before the practice trials, we added a "bubble popping" exercise to familiarize children with how to tap the tablet appropriately (a problem in experiment 1). 

## Procedure
The procedure was much the same. The smurfy puppet was swapped out for a more attractive smurfy stuffed animal. The experimental script was tightened. TODO link to materials for where the script is. 

## Data processing
Data was processed in the same way as experiment 1.

speed_mod_2 <- brm(time.sec ~ trial.num + (trial.num|gameId) + (1|target),
               data=speed_mod_data_2,
               file = here(mod_loc, "speed_2.rds"),
               prior=speed_priors,
               control = list(adapt_delta=.95))
```

```{r}
speed_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "speed_2.rds"))

```

 The first trial was `r stats_text(speed_mod_2, 1)`, and children got faster over time (`r stats_text(speed_mod_2, 2)`). 

## Description length

```{r, eval=F}

description_priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(5,10)", class="Intercept"),
set_prior("normal(0,5)", class="b"),
set_prior("normal(0,5)", class="sd"),
set_prior("lkj(1)", class="cor")
)

description_mod_data_2 <- clean_2 |> mutate(
                                  trial.num=trial-2) |> filter(type!="practice")

description_mod_2 <- brm(words ~ trial.num + (trial.num|gameId) + (1|target),
               data=description_mod_data_2,
               file = here(mod_loc, "description_2.rds"),
               prior=speed_priors,
               control = list(adapt_delta=.95))
```


```{r}
description_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_2.rds"))

```

 The initial length was `r stats_text(description_mod_2, 1)` and description length was relatively stable over time (`r stats_text(description_mod_2, 2)`).

We tried various ways of looking at the semantic similarities of descriptions children produced. TODO talk about SBERT

As a coarse comparison, we repeated the analysis from Experiment 1, comparing the similarity of descriptions to the same target for the same-speaker, same-game, or different-game. We modeled this as `r sim_across_between_form |> form()`. Utterances were more similar if they came from the same partnership (`r sim_across_between_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`) and were slightly more similar still if they came from the same person with the partnership (`r sim_across_between_2_results |> stats_text(3,3)`). The big differences in descriptions between games compared to within games is a measure of partner sensitivity -- children are more likely to use descriptions semantically similar to their partners than to another child. 

With the greater length of experiment 2, we are also able to look for change over time, that could be indicative of convergence to shared descriptions within a game and divergence between games. 

To look for convergence, we compare the utterances from the first three blocks to the descriptions in the last block: `r sim_to_last_form |> form()`. Over the first three blocks, descriptions do become increasingly similar to the last block description (`r sim_to_last_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). Descriptions are more similar to the last block if they come from the same child who gaves the description in the last block (`r sim_to_last_2_results |> stats_text(3,3)`). 

Another way to look for convergence is to look at the semantic distance between utterances in adjacent blocks: `r sim_to_next_form |> form()`. Although over time descriptions do get more similar to the last block utterance, the distance between adjacent block utterances is relatively constant `r sim_to_next_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`. 

Finally, we can see if descriptions in different games diverge across time: `r sim_across_form |> form()`. As the games progress, descriptions from different games become slightly further apart in semantic space (`r sim_across_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). 


# General Discussion

Summary of experiments

Limitations. The population of children at university nursery schools is non-representative, and the set of materials we used was also not that varied. This set of tangram images may be easier to distinguish and refer to than some sets used with adults, leading to overall shorter utterances. Probably shouldn't say based on this that children can "do reference" at age 4, but it is evidence that under supportive circumstances, a number of children at this age are able to. 

We also specifically target the construction of referring expressions that can be jointly understood. There are other parts of the coordination where help was provided in children seemed stuck or confused, such as when to make a choice or ask for more information. 

Broader implications

This work (along with other work on children's referential communicaiton) suggests that there's a more gradual development
Has implications for how we think about children's language development. There's debate over how that is ordered and whether communication/pragmatics is a final stage, or how all the stages are boostrapped (CITATIONS). This early ability to use language for communicative purposes is more consistent with the early pragmatics viewpoint. 

Suggestive of a gradual development where children's capabilities are increasing for a wide amount of childhood, as their working memory capacity and executive function improve and they are able to better track other's states of knowledge and keep track of wider arrays of images.
