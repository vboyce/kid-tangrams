abstract: > 
  Learning language requires learning not only the content of language, but also how to use language to communicate. Iterated reference games provide a window into such skills, requiring rich communication as participants converge on mutually understandable names for initially novel referents. Some early experiments are interpreted as evidence that 4-5-year-old children cannot generate the mutually understandable names needed to succeed in an iterated reference game. Here, we revisit young children's referential communicative abilities using a simpler, child-friendly paradigm. Across TODO pairs of children, we found that 4-5-year-olds successfully established reference with each other. Children were TODO% accurate, and they often used descriptions similar to their partner's. These findings suggest that children’s capacity to construct effective referring expressions in novel contexts emerges earlier than once thought, consistent with the view that children show early pragmatic competence in supportive contexts.

# Introduction

Learning a language requires learning not only the content of that language, but also how to use the language to communicate. One case study for language use is referential communication, the ability to describe a target so an interlocutor can pick it out from a set of possibilities. Adults show sensitivity to both the visual context and their audience during referential communication, calibrating the description they provide to their beliefs about the interlocutor's knowledge state. 

Iterated reference games provide an important paradigm for studying referential communication. In these games, one player repeatedly describes a set of abstract shapes to a partner so they can identify the target images [@clark1986; @krauss1964; @hawkins2020dynamics; @boyce2024]. Over repetition, features of the initial descriptions are conventionalized as each pair comes to agree on a shared understanding of how to label each image. Success at this task requires mastery of a number of linguistic and communicative skills, including producing adequate initial descriptions, monitoring for comprehension, asking for clarification, and appropriately using the shared conversation history to inform later referring expressions. 
Studying how children play iterated reference games can provide insight into the developmental trajectory of the ability to produce referential expressions in order to achieve joint understanding. 

One influential early study suggested that 4-5-year-old preschoolers struggle with child-child referential communication [@glucksberg1966]. In their paradigm, one child was given a set of 6 blocks in a specific order. Their task was to describe the image on each block so their partner could pick out their corresponding block. As children described and selected blocks, they stacked them on pegs. While 4-5-year-old children succeeded on practice trials with familiar shapes and visual access to each other's blocks, children failed on critical trials where the blocks had abstract drawings and there was no visual access. Even after multiple rounds with the same images, children were not able to correctly order the blocks. @glucksberg1966 attributed children's communicative failures to their production of ego-centric descriptions that did not account for the other child's perspective.  

Similar experiments with older children indicated a gradual improvement through adolescence both for initial accuracy and for the increase in accuracy across repetitions. Still, even the 9th grade sample was noticeably worse than the adult college student sample [@glucksberg1967; @krauss1969]. Given that even teenagers had difficulties with the task, the complex stacking paradigm and the large number of potential targets may have posed task demands that prevented accurate measurement of children's abilities.

* any other studies we should include
* any studies we want to say more about than we had room for in cogsci

More recently, though no evidence has directly contradicted @glucksberg1966, a number of other studies have revealed early emerging skills in the preschool years that support the use of referential communication. Preschool-aged children are faster to select a target when it is referred to in a consistent way [@graham2013; @matthews2010]. When a change in visual context renders previous descriptions overinformative, 6-year-olds (but not 4-year-olds) are more likely to use consistent referential expressions when they keep talking to the same partner, but switch to simpler terms with a new partner [@koymen2014] These studies suggest that young children are sensitive to the norm of consistent descriptions in cooperative communication. 

Further, preschool-aged children adapt the informativeness of their referential expressions based on the visual content available to their interlocutor [@matthews2006;@nadig2002;@nilsen2009]. By age 5, children integrate information about other's perspectives into their comprehension of utterances [@sanjuan2015]. 4-5 year old children are faster to rule out competitors and select the correct target when they have learned that their partner is not aware of the competitor object. Children's ability to take partner's perspectives and knowledge states into account is evolving over the preschool years, but overall, by late preschool, children can reason about others’ perspectives to communicate more effectively. 

While children are sensitive to others’ perspectives, they still struggle to appropriately tailor the specificity of their utterances to the visual context, often resulting in under-informative utterances [@matthews2012; @leung2024].  When children must describe one of two very similar images, 4 and 5-year-olds sometimes neglect to mention the relevant features, although they do better when playing in an interactive game than when not [@grigoroglou2019]. By 5 years old, children are sensitive to over- and under-informative utterances, asking for clarification on some under-informative utterances and taking longer to make selections on over-informative utterances [@morisseau2013]. 

A common thread among many developmental studies is that children perform better when the cognitive load of the task is reduced, i.e. when there are fewer possible referents [@abbot-smith2015; @sanjuan2015].  These findings paired with evidence of emerging communicative skills in young children suggest that tailored referential expression production is possible in children, but it is likely to be masked when the task demands are too high. 

Since @glucksberg1966, few studies have revisited the question of whether children can successfully communicate in an iterated reference game. In one study, 8-10-year-olds exhibited adult-like patterns of increasing accuracy, increasing speed, and shorter descriptions across repetitions, but children’s accuracy was still far below adult performance and highly variable between dyads [@branigan2016]. In an iterated reference game where 4- and 6- year-olds communicated to each other via gestures, children were successful at communicating a repertoire of 5 image options with each other [@bohn2019]. Children's comprehension increased over repetitions, and when children switched roles, they often used their partner's gestures back at each other. The 6-year-olds showed greater within dyad similarity in gestures than the 4-year-olds, indicating that children's abilities to form conventional pacts is increasing in this age range. 

In an iterated reference game using natural language to communicate, 4-8-year-old children succeeded when playing with a parent using a simple, child-friendly tablet-based task [@leung2024]. In this task, even 4-year-olds had an initial accuracy above 80% on two-way choice, which rose to above 90% in later repetitions [@leung2024]. Together, the recent work on both iterated and non-iterated reference games with young children provides evidence of young children’s ability to communicate with each other and with adults under the right conditions. The late preschool years are a time of rapid development for children as a number of communicative skills are improving between the ages of 3 and 6 [TODO maybe more citations, or re-citations]. 

Given the task demands in @glucksberg1966 and work showing that children can succeed in a less demanding paradigm, here we revisit the question of child-child referential communication. In the present study, we re-examine young children's ability to establish effective referring expressions with each other in an iterated reference game using a simplified tablet-based paradigm. Across three studies including a total of ZZ pairs of 4-5-year-old preschool children, we found that preschool-aged children were successful in an iterated reference game, suggesting that children's capacity to construct effective referring expressions in novel contexts emerges earlier than once claimed.


# Experiment 1 

## Methods

Our goal for Experiment 1 was to test young children's ability to coordinate to produce descriptions of abstract shapes that their partner could understand. Young children can be very sensitive to task demands and cognitive load [@turan-kucuk2024; @keen2003; @carruthers2013], so we adapted the experimental framework from @leung2024, and further simplified it by reducing the total pool of targets and the number of trials. This experiment was pre-registered at [anonymized link](https://osf.io/kcv8j?view_only=fd55733671194962b868a4ba19377631). 

### Participants

4 and 5-year-old children were recruited from a university preschool during the school day. Children played with another child from the same class. Experiment 1 was conducted between June and August 2023. Pairs of children were included in analyses if they completed at least 8 of the 12 critical trials. We had 19 games that completed 12 critical trials, and 1 game that completed 11 critical trials. Of the 40 children, 21 were girls, and the median age was 57 months, with a range of 48-70 months. An additional XX games were excluded for being pilot runs or not completing enough trials. 

### Materials
For the target stimuli, we used four of the ten tangram images from @leung2024, chosen based on visual dissimilarity (Figure \ref{game}B). We coded the matching game using Empirica [@almaatouq2021], hosted it on a server, and then accessed the game on tablets that were locked in a kiosk mode so children could not navigate away from the game.

### Procedure
Once a pair of children agreed to play the game, a research assistant took them to a quiet testing room. Children were introduced to a stuffed animal "Smurfy" who wanted to play a matching game. Children sat across a table from each other, each with a tablet in front of them (Figure \ref{game}A). On each trial, one child was the "teller" and saw a black box around one of two images on their screen and was asked to "tell Smurfy what they see" in the black box. The "guesser" saw the same two images in a randomized order and tried to select the described image to help Smurfy make a match. When the guesser selected an image, both children received feedback in form of a smiley or frowny face and an excited or disappointed sound. After each trial, children switched roles. Children passed Smurfy back and forth to keep track of whether they were the "guesser" or "teller" on a given trial.

Children completed two warm-up trials with black and white images of familiar shapes, followed by 3 blocks of the 4 target images (Figure \ref{game}C). Targets were randomly paired with another of the critical images as the foil. 

The experimenters running the game did not volunteer descriptions, but they did scaffold the interaction, prompting children to describe the images, and sometimes repeating children's statements (especially when utterances were inaudible or the child did not respond immediately; this aspect of the procedure was modified in Experiment 2). The entire interaction was video-recorded. 

### Data processing

Children's selections and the time to selection were recorded from the experiment software. Children's descriptions were automatically transcribed from the video using Whisper [@radford2022] for the first pass and then hand-corrected by experimenters. Transcripts were hand-annotated for when each trial started, who said each line, and what referential descriptions were used. 
We excluded trials where the "teller" did not produce a description, or where all description was unintelligible and impossible to transcribe. After exclusions, we had `r joint_data |> filter(expt=="1") |> nrow()` trials remaining. 

Statistical analyses were run in brms [@burkner2018] with weakly informative priors. We report estimates and 95% credible intervals. The experimental set-up, analysis code, de-identified transcripts, and performance data for all experiments is available at [anonymized repo](https://osf.io/7d3ne/?view_only=d094ccd6438741bfbcaa7fde9fbb56b2).


## Results
### Accuracy and speed

```{r fig-accuracy, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Children's accuracy at selecting the correct target over time. Error bars are bootstrapped 95% CIs with a linear trend line overlaid. \\label{acc}" }

```

```{r}
acc_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "acc_1.rds")) |> mutate(across(c(`Estimate`, `lower`, `upper`), ~ exp(.)))

acc_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "acc_1.rds"))
```

Our primary measure of interest was whether children could accurately communicate the intended target, as prior work is often interpreted as indicating the children at kindergarten age cannot communicate about abstract shapes successfully [@glucksberg1966]. To test for changes in accuracy over time, we fit a Bayesian mixed effects logistic regression predicting accuracy.^[`r acc_form |> form()`] Children's accuracy was above chance (Odds Ratio: `r stats_text(acc_mod_1,1)`), and their accuracy slightly increased over the game (OR of one trial later: `r stats_text(acc_mod_1, 2)`, Figure \ref{acc}). This level of accuracy is generally in-line with accuracies from 4-year-olds playing with their parents in @leung2024 and indicates that children can understand and succeed at the task. 



```{r}
speed_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "speed_1.rds"))

speed_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "speed_1.rds"))
```

As another measure of children's performance, we looked at how long children spent on each trial. We ran a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression predicting the time to selection in seconds.^[`r speed_form |> form()`] The first critical trial averaged `r stats_text(speed_mod_1, 1)` seconds, and children got faster over time (`r stats_text(speed_mod_1, 2)` seconds / trial). Children were able to achieve the same accuracy in less time, suggesting that they were becoming more efficient at completing the task. 

### Description length

```{r description, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Length of description produced by the teller each trial. Grey dots are individual data points, colored dots are per trial means with bootstrapped 95% CIs. \\label{length}" }
joint_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = trial+1, y = words, color = type)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .5, color = "grey") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 20, 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 4.5, lty="dashed")+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 8.5, lty="dashed")+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 12.5, lty="dashed")+
  scale_color_manual(values = time_palette) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  xlab("Trial") +
  ylab("Words") +
  facet_grid(str_c("Expt ",expt) ~ .) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    strip.background = element_blank()
  )
```




```{r}
description_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_1.rds"))

description_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "description_1.rds"))

description_robustness_mod_1 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "all_description_1.rds"))
```

In iterated reference games with adults, description lengths usually shorten over repeated references [@clark1986; @hawkins2020dynamics; @boyce2024]. We were curious if children's descriptions would display the same trend, so we ran a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression predicting the number of words in the description the "teller" produced.^[`r description_form |> form()`] On the first critical trial, descriptions averaged `r stats_text(description_mod_1, 1)` words, and description length was relatively stable over time (change of `r stats_text(description_mod_1, 2)` words per trial, Figure \ref{length}). Thus, children's increasing speed was not from shorter utterances, but instead from some combination of improved task understanding, faster utterance planning, and faster decisions of what to select.

TODO this description metric is just the length of the description, taking out repetition/rephrasing from the child. We could also include the robustness check which is the length of all the (on-topic) teller-guesser interaction (including repeating/rephrasing, questions, I don't knows, etc)


TOOD maybe move this paragraph Some examples to illustrate the variety of effective descriptions children employed are shown in Table \ref{example} (these specific examples are from Experiment 2, but both experiments had similar distributions of descriptions). TODO add examples from expt 3 as well??

### Convergence 

```{r sims, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Semantic similarity between pairs of descriptions from different sources. Dots are means and lines are bootstrapped 95% CIs.  \\label{sim}" }

  )
```


```{r}
sim_across_between_1_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_between_1.rds"))

sim_across_between_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_across_between_1.rds"))
```

While description length is often used as a proxy for measuring convention formation, it does not capture semantic overlap between utterances. @boyce2024 introduced a more sensitive measure of semantic convergence that compares the content of utterances using word embeddings to trace how similarities within and across games change over time. To measure convergence of utterances, they compared how the similarities between utterances from a given block and the final block (conventionalized) utterances increased over the course of the game. With only 3 blocks of descriptions, we do not expect semantic similarity for descriptions of a given target to show any meaningful change over time. However, we can test for a more coarse measure of sensitivity to partner: whether children's utterances are more like their partner's than children in other games'. If children are fully ego-centric [as suggested by @glucksberg1966], their choices of descriptions would be independent from their partners. 

Following the methods of @boyce2024, we embedded each description in a semantic vector space using S-BERT [@reimers2019], and then used the cosine between embeddings as a measure of semantic similarity. 

We compared the semantic similarities between descriptions of the same target based on who produced the description (Figure \ref{sim}).  We used a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression to predict similarity.^[`r sim_across_between_form |> form()`] Utterances were more similar if they came from the same partnership (`r sim_across_between_1_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). Utterances were slightly more similar still if they came from the same person (`r sim_across_between_1_results |> stats_text(3,3)`), which is expected since children are likely to be fairly consistent with themselves. However, children used descriptions that were much more similar to their partner's than to other children's (Figure \ref{sim}), indicating sensitivity to their partner's expressions. 
TODO consider dropping this because it's not that strong an analysis? 

## Discussion

In Experiment 1, we adapted the paradigm of @leung2024 for pairs of children, taking an already simple set-up and making it shorter. Our goal was to see if young children were at all able to provide adequate descriptions, so children received a lot of scaffolding around the experimental interaction. Sometimes, this scaffolding included experimenters echoing children's descriptions, which could potentially influence children's responses. In Experiment 2, we repeated the same paradigm, with a tighter experimental script and a larger sample size.

# Experiment 2 

## Methods

As Experiment 2 was very similar to Experiment 1, we focus on the changes made compared to Experiment 1. Experiment 2 was pre-registered at [anonymized link](https://osf.io/y2dax/?view_only=fd55733671194962b868a4ba19377631). 

The biggest change between the experiments was increasing the number of repetitions of target stimuli from 3 to 4 (from 12 to 16 trials). The greater number of trials in Experiment 2 made it possible to look for changes over time that could be indicative of convergence to shared descriptions within a game and divergence between games. 

### Participants
Experiment 2 was run between March and August of 2024, at the same preschool as Experiment 1. No children participated in both experiments. 30 pairs of children completed all 16 critical trials, and 1 pair of children completed 10 critical trials. Our target age range was 4 and 5-year-olds, but one older 3-year-old was unintentionally included. Of the 62 children, 30 were girls, and the children had a median age of 56 months, and a range of 45-69 months. An additional XX games were excluded for being pilot runs or not completing enough trials.  

### Materials
The same 4 critical images were used as in Experiment 1. In response to some children struggling with the abrupt switch from familiar to non-nameable shapes, we introduced more practice trials for Experiment 2. We used a total of 4 practice trials to provide a gradient from familiar shapes to less recognizable, blockier shapes (Figure \ref{game}D). 

### Procedure
The procedure was much the same as Experiment 1(Figure \ref{game}D). We added an initial "bubble popping" exercise to give children practice tapping the tablet appropriately (this was an issue for some children in Experiment 1). The experimental script was fully written out and memorized by experimenters so children all received the same instructions. We wrote up contingency statements that the experimenter could use to prompt children who were not giving descriptions or making selections. Experimenters helped with game mechanics such as whose turn it was to tell and who should press the screen, but avoided contributing or repeating any content about the images or the descriptions. 

### Data processing
Data were processed in the same way as Experiment 1. After excluding trials where children did not give a description or where the experimenter echoed a child's description, we had `r joint_data |> filter(expt=="2") |> nrow()` trials total. 

## Results
### Accuracy and speed

```{r}
acc_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "acc_2.rds")) |> mutate(across(c(`Estimate`, `lower`, `upper`), ~ exp(.)))
```


```{r}
speed_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "speed_2.rds"))
```

In Experiment 2, children's accuracy was above chance (Odds Ratio: `r stats_text(acc_mod_2,1)`) and relatively stable over time (OR of one trial later: `r stats_text(acc_mod_2, 2)`, Figure \ref{acc}). 
The first critical trial averaged `r stats_text(speed_mod_2, 1)` seconds, and children got faster over time (`r stats_text(speed_mod_2, 2)` seconds / trial). <!--Children were initially faster in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, possibly due to the increased number of practice trials and pre-training on how to press the screens. -->Taken together, we find more evidence that children can successfully communicate with each other about these abstract shapes, and do so with increasing efficiency. 

### Description length


```{r}
description_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_2.rds"))

description_robustness_mod_2 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "all_description_2.rds"))

```


The average length of descriptions on the first trial was `r stats_text(description_mod_2, 1)` words and description length was relatively stable over time (change of `r stats_text(description_mod_2, 2)` words / trial, Figure \ref{length}). This finding is comparable to Experiment 1, again finding that children produce short utterances without much change in length over time.

### Convergence 


```{r}
sim_across_between_2_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_between_2.rds"))

sim_across_between_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_across_between_2.rds"))

sim_across_2_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_2.rds"))

sim_across_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_across_2.rds"))

sim_to_next_2_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_next_2.rds"))

sim_to_next_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_to_next_2.rds"))

sim_to_last_2_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_last_2.rds"))

sim_to_last_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_to_last_2.rds"))
```

As a coarse measure of partner-sensitivity, we repeated the semantic analysis from Experiment 1. Utterances were more similar if they came from the same partnership (`r sim_across_between_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`) and were slightly more similar if they came from the same person (`r sim_across_between_2_results |> stats_text(3,3)`). 

As Experiment 2 had 4 blocks, we examined whether descriptions were converging semantically toward the final description. We compared the utterances from the first three blocks to the descriptions in the last block using a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression predicting similarity.^[`r sim_to_last_form |> form()`] Over the first three blocks, descriptions became increasingly similar to the last block description (`r sim_to_last_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). Descriptions were marginally more similar if they came from the same child, which is expected as a sign of internal consistency TODO rephrase (`r sim_to_last_2_results |> stats_text(3,3)`). Although over time descriptions did get more similar to the last block utterance, the semantic distance between adjacent block utterances was relatively constant (`r sim_to_next_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). 

Partnerships often diverged from one another as groups focused on distinct aspects of the image. We tested whether descriptions in different games diverged over time using a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression.^[`r sim_across_form |> form()`] As the games progressed, descriptions to the same target from different games became slightly less similar (`r sim_across_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`), which indicates that games are converging to different conventions. These patterns of increasing similarity within games and increasing divergence between games qualitatively match the patterns found for adults [@boyce2024].

# Experiment 3

The first two experiments demonstrated children's ability to communicate referentially, but were limited in their generality by the use of a specific set of 4 fairly humanoid tangram figures. To explore the generality of the results to a different set of potentially harder tangram stimuli, we conducted Experiment 3. 

## Methods
As Experiment 2 was very similar to Experiment 2, we focus on the changes made compared to Experiment 2. Experiment 3 was pre-registered at TODO [anonymized link]. 

The procedure for Experiment 3 matched Experiment 2, and the only change was in the stimuli used.


### Participants
Experiment 3 was run between XX and YY , at the same preschool as Experiments 1 and 2. Because the stimuli changed, we allowed children who had participated in a prior experiment to participate again, and ZZ participants in experiment 2 were also in experiment 3. TODO pairs of children completed all 16 critical trials, and TODO. Our target age range was 4 and 5-year-olds. Of the TODO children, QQ were girls, and the children had a median age of ZZ months, and a range of XX-YY months. An additional XX games were excluded for being pilot runs, including repeat participants, not completing enough trials, or including a 3-year-old participant.  

### Materials
A different set of critical images were used (see Figure TODO). These were chosen from a set of commonly used tangram images (CITATIONS), to be fairly distinct from each other. We also switched the stimuli for the 3rd and 4th practice trials to be more abstract, so children would not be surprised by the critical stimuli not having convention names (TODO figure). 

### Procedure
The procedure was the same as for Experiment 2. The bubble popping practice was modified so that both rounds of bubbles were colored dots, because children in Experiment 2 sometimes did not identify the smiley faces as more bubbles to pop. 

### Data processing
Data were processed in the same way as Experiment 1. After excluding trials where children did not give a description or where the experimenter echoed a child's description, we had TODO trials total. 

## Results
### Accuracy and speed

```{r}
acc_mod_3 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "acc_3.rds")) |> mutate(across(c(`Estimate`, `lower`, `upper`), ~ exp(.)))

acc_pct<- joint_data |> group_by(expt) |> summarize(acc=mean(correct, na.rm=T)*100)
```


```{r}
speed_mod_3 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "speed_3.rds"))
```

In Experiment 3, children's accuracy was above chance (Odds Ratio: `r stats_text(acc_mod_3,1)`) and relatively stable over time (OR of one trial later: `r stats_text(acc_mod_3, 2)`, Figure \ref{acc}). Children's overall accuracy was lower in Experiment 3(`r round(acc_pct |> pluck(2,3))`%) than in the prior experiments (`r round(acc_pct |> pluck(2,2))`%), potentially indicating that the stimuli were more difficult. 

The first critical trial averaged `r stats_text(speed_mod_3, 1)` seconds, and children got faster over time (`r stats_text(speed_mod_3, 2)` seconds / trial). Overall, we find evidence that children's ability to communicate with increasing efficiency generalizes to different abstract images.  

### Description length


```{r}
description_mod_3 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_3.rds"))

description_robustness_mod_3 <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "all_description_3.rds"))

```


The average length of descriptions on the first trial was `r stats_text(description_mod_3, 1)` words and description length was relatively stable over time (change of `r stats_text(description_mod_3, 2)` words / trial, Figure \ref{length}). TODO after we double check data again, but might be overall more words than other expts? 

### Convergence 

TODO reverify everything after data review + full sample 

```{r}
sim_across_between_3_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_between_3.rds"))


sim_across_3_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_3.rds"))

sim_to_next_3_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_next_3.rds"))

sim_to_last_3_results <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_last_3.rds"))

```

We repeat the semantic analyses from Experiment 2. To start with, we again found that utterances were more similar if they came from the same partnership (`r sim_across_between_3_results |> stats_text(2,3)`) and if they came from the same person (`r sim_across_between_3_results |> stats_text(3,3)`). 

Over the first three blocks, descriptions became increasingly similar to the last block description (`r sim_to_last_3_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). Over time, the semantic distance between adjacent block utterances increased slightly (`r sim_to_next_2_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). 

Unlike in Experiment 2, we did not find that different games became less similar over time (`r sim_across_3_results |> stats_text(2,3)`). 
TODO interpretation



# Joint analysis

## Pooled analysis

```{r}
acc_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "acc_meta.rds")) |> mutate(across(c(`Estimate`, `lower`, `upper`), ~ exp(.)))

description_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_meta.rds"))

description_robustness_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "all_description_meta.rds"))

sim_across_between_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_between_meta.rds"))


sim_to_last_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_last_meta.rds"))

sim_to_next_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_to_next_meta.rds"))

sim_across_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_across_meta.rds"))
```

As the two experiments were similar to one another, we re-ran models pooling the data across the three experiments, using experiment number as a random effect. Pooling the three experiments, children's accuracy was above chance (OR: `r stats_text(acc_mod_meta,1)`) and accuracy numerically increased over the course of the game, although the credible interval included 0 (OR of one trial later: `r stats_text(acc_mod_meta, 2)`). 

TODO decide whether to discuss speed here again. 

Descriptions produced by tellers averaged `r stats_text(description_mod_meta, 1)` words on the first trial, and description length was relatively stable over time (change of `r stats_text(description_mod_meta, 2)` words per trial).
Utterances were more similar if they came from the same partnership (increase in cosine similarity: `r sim_across_between_mod_meta |> stats_text(2,3)`) and were more similar still if they came from the same person within the partnership (`r sim_across_between_mod_meta |> stats_text(3,3)`).

For other semantic analyses, we pooled across experiments 2 and 3 which had 4 blocks. In the combined model, we found that the similarity the last block utterance increased across blocks (`r stats_text(sim_to_last_mod_meta, 2,3)`) and was higher when the same child produced both utterances (`r stats_text(sim_to_last_mod_meta, 3,3)`). In a combined model, similarity to the next block utterance also increased across blocks (`r stats_text(sim_to_next_mod_meta, 2,3)`) and was higher when the same child produced both utterances (`r stats_text(sim_to_next_mod_meta, 3,3)`). Across the two experiments, utterances from different pairs to the same stimulus tended to decrease in similarity across blocks (`r stats_text(sim_across_mod_meta, 2,3)`). 

While some of these effects were small and thus not all effects were robustness detectable in each experiment by itself, the overall picture is consistent in direction with the patterns of convergence and divergence reported in reference games between adults [@boyce2024]. 


## Sensitivity to prior result

```{r}
sim_acc_to_next_mod_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "sim_acc_to_next_meta.rds"))
sim_acc_to_next_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "sim_acc_to_next_meta.rds"))

```

We might expect that whether a description was successful influences whether the same description, or a variant of it, is employed in future rounds. Intuitively, successful descriptions can be copied and built upon, while unsuccessful descriptions should be replaced by a fresh attempt. To test whether accuracy is predictive of similarity to future descriptions, we ran a post-hoc Bayesian linear model predicting similarity to the next block description in terms of accuracy.^[`r form(sim_acc_to_next_form)`] Descriptions that elicited a correct response were more similar to the next block description (`r stats_text(sim_acc_to_next_mod_meta, 2, 3)`) with no substantial interaction with block number or whether both descriptions came from the same teller. This pattern of results is consistent with the expectation that children are more likely to stick to their own description or repeat the other child's description if it was previously successful. <!--Numerically, the size of the boost for being correct was similar to the size of the boost from coming from the same person `r stats_text(sim_acc_to_next_mod_meta, 6,3)`. -->

## Age and gender as moderators of referential success

We did not account for children's age and gender when pairing children to play the game, so children of different ages (within the 4-5 year old target age range) sometimes played together, and children sometimes played with same-gender and sometimes with different-gender partners. As children of this age are rapidly developing their linguistic skills (TODO CITATION NEEDED), we looked at possible effects of children's age and gender on performance as an exploratory measure. 

```{r age-acc, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=7, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "Accuracy of selections across all experiments, graphed by the mean age of child in that game, and colored by the number of girls in the pair. Each dot is a game, and linear fits are overlayed. \\label{ageacc}" }

  labs(x="Mean age of participants (months)", y="Accuracy", color="Number of girls")+
  geom_jitter(data=joint_data|>
  mutate(mean_age = (listener_age + speaker_age) / 2, girlness = (listener_gender == "female") + (speaker_gender == "female")) |> group_by(expt, game, mean_age, girlness) |> summarize(correct=mean(correct, na.rm=T))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 16, 1), expand = c(0.02, 0.02)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, .2), expand = c(0, 0.04)) +

  geom_hline(yintercept = .5) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#DC322FFF","#2AA198FF" ,"#268BD2FF"  ))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", show.legend=F)
```

```{r age-words, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "t", fig.align = "center", out.width="100%", fig.width=7, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "Number of words of description produced by the teller across all experiments, graphed by the age of teller in that game, and colored by teller gender. Each dot is a game, and linear fits are overlayed. \\label{agewords}" }
joint_data |>  ggplot(aes(x = speaker_age, y = words, color = speaker_gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", show.legend=F)+
  geom_jitter(data=joint_data |> group_by(speaker_age, speaker, expt, game, speaker_gender) |> summarize(words=mean(words, na.rm=T)))+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#268BD2FF", "#DC322FFF"))+
  labs(x="Teller Age (months)", y="Words", color="Teller gender")
```

```{r}
acc_demog_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "acc_demog.rds")) |> mutate(across(c(`Estimate`, `lower`, `upper`), ~ exp(.)))

acc_demog_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "acc_demog.rds"))

description_demog_meta <- read_rds(here(mod_results, "description_demog.rds"))
description_demog_form <- read_rds(here(mod_form, "description_demog.rds"))
```

The effects of children's age and gender on their performance are shown in Figure \ref{ageacc}. We ran a mixed effects logistic regression, where we considered possible effects of the age of each child (centered at mean age of all the children who participated) and the gender of each child^[`r form(acc_demog_form)`]. Accuracy was higher for older children (OR for one month older speaker: `r stats_text(acc_demog_meta, 3,2)`, OR for one month older listener: `r stats_text(acc_demog_meta, 2,2)`). Accuracy was also higher when the listener was a girl (OR: `r stats_text(acc_demog_meta, 4,2)`), but was not credibly higher when the speaker was a girl (OR: `r stats_text(acc_demog_meta, 5,2)`). 

For description length, we tested whether children's age or gender effected how many words they produced in descriptions when in the teller role (Figure \ref{agewords}). We also ran a mixed effects linear regression, where we considered the ages and genders of both children as possible predictors^[`r form(description_demog_form)`]. Older children tended to produce longer descriptions (effect of one month older `r stats_text(description_demog_meta,3,2)`), but there was no effect of age of listener (`r stats_text(description_demog_meta, 2,2)`). For gender, there was no effect of teller gender on description length (girls produced `r stats_text(description_demog_meta, 5,2)` words compared to boys), but tellers produced longer descriptions for boy guessers (`r stats_text(description_demog_meta, 4,2)`). There were not substantial effects of trial order or interactions between demographics and trial order. 

It is curious that listener gender but not speaker gender affected description length, but for this task, it is unclear how description length would be expected to map onto linguistic sophistication for this task and demographic. For accuracy, the age and gender effects could be reflective of any of a number of developing capacities, including linguistic, executive functioning, or social/theory of mind. 
These findings of a slight effect of age and a slight female-advantage are consistent with a wider literature of TODO

# Qualitative variation in interaction structure

Pairs of children varied significantly in how well they could scaffold their own interaction versus needed reminders from experimenters about the structure of the game. In one game, the experimenter provided no input after the practice trials because the children rapidly took turns producing referring expressions and selecting the targets. Their advantage could partially be due to being best friends with each other; all children were paired with another child from the same classroom who they were willing to play with, but friendship levels varied. 

Some children asked clarifying questions of their partner, but knowing how much information to provide was not always consistent. In one game, child A described the figure as "A human", prompting child B to note "There's two humans." Later in the game, child B used the description "A human", leading child A to ask "Which one?", which child B clarified with "The one that is walking". This anecdote illustrates how emerging abilities can be inconsistent -- finding a description inadequate as a guesser does not always translate into providing a more informative description as a teller.

* maybe cut this section
* do want to make the point that there's really wide variability (consistent with older kids and also adults for that matter) -- some pairs one kid does the describing including of options and the other chooses

* may want to be clear that structuring the interaction in an effective way is a skill that not all the kiddos have -- some relied more on the experimenter saying whose turn and needed more prompting with "do you want to give more hints" or "do you want to ask a question". whereas other groups rapidly produced descriptions and then either clicked or asked for (and got) clarification (either completely on their own, or after the option was questions offered as a possibility). 
that said, even when children were struggling, some of their attempts such as gesturing or turning ipads or asking (can you show me) are indicative of attempts at conversational monitoring and solving the communication problem (albeit not in ways that followed the "rules" of the game)
where we see what looks like failures it may be hard to tell what part isn't working (is it knowing what i know, or what other knows, or cognitive control, or producing questions, or sampling)

# (unclear if include)
could also do some qualitative comparison of the *types* of descriptions that kiddos give versus kid-parent vs adult ? 

# General discussion

Prominent early studies claimed that young children cannot overcome their ego-centrism to coordinate with each other in reference games [@glucksberg1966]. However, more recent developmental work has found that young children show emerging communicative and pragmatic sensitivity, especially when cognitive demands are low. Recent work has established that children are successful at producing and understanding referential expressions to novel shapes when playing reference games with their parents. Here, we revisited the question of preschoolers' performance in child-child reference games, using a scaffolded paradigm to reduce extraneous task demands. 

Across 3 experiments and TODO pairs of 4 and 5-year-old children, we tested how well children could produce referential expressions that allowed their partner to find a matching abstract shape. Children varied substantially in what sorts of descriptions they produced, but overall accuracy was high (TODO%), indicating that children were generally able to produce adequate descriptions. Additionally, children's utterances showed signs of converging toward conceptual pacts. While this task is substantially scaled down relative to measures used for adult competence, it does suggest that the relevant communication skills are present at least in rudimentary form by the end of the preschool years. 

Unlike adults, children did not display an increase in accuracy or a shortening of referential expressions over the course of the game. Still, our findings show that descriptions became increasingly similar to descriptions in the last block and that successful utterances were more similar to future utterances, suggesting that children are adapting their descriptions as the game unfolds. These null findings are likely a result of initially high accuracy in the first block and initially short utterances that leave little room for reduction. 

It is unclear to what extent the uniformly short descriptions we observed are a product of the simplified task or children's behavioral differences from adults. In this case, the low number of options and relatively easy-to-describe shapes may have obviated the need for long initial descriptions. Indeed, adult controls in @leung2024 used shorter initial descriptions than adults in studies with larger arrays of harder to distinguish images [@hawkins2020dynamics; @boyce2024]. However, young children may also struggle to produce longer descriptions, and young children may be more willing to take guesses when adults would seek additional clarification. Especially in light of other work suggesting that conceptual pact formation and reduction in utterance length sometimes decouple in adults [@boyce2024], further empirical work on the factors driving verbosity in reference games is warranted. 

The generalizability of our results is limited by the target population, the target images, and the task structure. We sampled a convenience population of children at a university nursery school. The set of tangram images may be easier to distinguish and have higher codability than other target images used in adult reference games. We specifically targeted children's abilities to construct referring expressions that can be jointly understood, so children were provided scaffolding around taking turns and talking to their partner. Thus, children's performance should be taken as a proof-of-concept about ability, rather than a claim about how generally children spontaneously demonstrate these abilities. 

Even within this population, we observed some substantial pair to pair differences. Pairs varied in what types of descriptions they have, how readily the gave them, as well as how well they understood the "rules" of the game and how much they cooperated with the rules. While we did not aim to test 3 year olds, the few 3 year olds who we tested accidentally did fine. 

Our qualitative impression is that it was more common for children to hit limits around understanding the game structure (ex. that the "teller" doesn't press the ipad),  cooperating with the game (ex. not trying to show the ipad to their partner, not pressing buttons before their partner has a change to describe), and understanding that this wasn't a test about the "name" of the shape, moreso than being truely able to describe an unknown referent adequately.
Pairs of children did very more in how sensitive they were to collaborating with their partner and adapting descriptions based on their partners descriptions and their prior success. Generally, it's hard to push at the lower limits of some of children's abilities because many skills are changing over the same time frame and variables that may not be of primary interest, such as patience and instruction-following, can influence the outcomes. 

In the broader picture of language acquisition, there is debate over the timing of the emergence of communicative and pragmatic abilities relative to the acquisition of grammar and meaning. On one side, children seem to learn literal semantics far before they display an understanding of some pragmatic implicatures [@huang2009; @noveck2001]; on the other, sensitivity to communicative intent is an early emerging skill that develops in parallel with linguistic knowledge and may bootstrap language learning [@bates1974; @bohn2019a; @tomasello2008]. Our current findings are most consistent with a gradual development of children's communicative and linguistic skills, where the skills emerge early and then are refined over time, as children's cognitive capacities increase. At 4-5 years old, children are already able to establish novel referential conventions with one another as part of their broader ability to communicate and coordinate.
